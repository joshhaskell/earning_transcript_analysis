Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Scott, and good morning everyone. Today American reported an adjusted pre-tax profit of approximately $362 million for the third quarter, an earnings result that was above the high-end of our latest EPS guidance range. The American Airlines team continues to produce strong results, and as we look ahead to the rest of the year, we continue to prioritize reliability, profitability, accountability, and strengthening the balance sheet. We are also focused on taking care of the team. We are very pleased to have finalized a new contract with the Allied Pilots Association in August. The agreement delivers significant compensation and quality of life improvements to our pilots, while allowing us to expand our training capacity to support underutilized aircraft and our future flying. We're also working toward new agreements for our flight attendants and agents. We're running a strong and reliable operation involving our commercial offerings, taking care of our team and customers, producing free cash flow, and strengthening our balance sheet. All of this speaks to our steadfast focus on controlling what we can control. And we are proud to say that we are delivering on our commitments. Now before discussing our results in more detail, on behalf of all of us at American, I want to say how shocked and saddened we are by the horrific attacks in Israel, and we join the international community in condemning these acts of hate and violence. We are devastated by the incredible loss of innocent life. We're making every effort to care for our team members, who are impacted by this tragedy and to keep our team members safe, while also working with the U.S. Government to help find safe travel options for customers trying to depart the region. The safety and security of our team members, customers, and their families remains our top priority. Turning now to our financial results. We produced record third quarter revenues of approximately $13.5 billion, driven by a resilient demand environment and record travel rewards program revenue. Domestic demand remains steady, while international demand continues to drive revenue growth, led by the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Central America. During the third quarter, we saw year-over-year growth in corporate and government revenue, with a return to more traditional seasonality trends. We remain encouraged by what we're seeing with demand and revenue from unmanaged business travel. Importantly, more customers than ever are choosing our Travel Rewards program by acquiring our co-brand credit cards in record numbers, enrolling in the Advantage program, and shopping for our product through our direct channels. Co-brand mileage sales growth continues to outpace airline capacity and GDP growth, driving increased levels of loyalty and revenue production from card users. In the third quarter, approximately 80% of our bookings came from our own channels and modern retailing technology, which is up approximately 11 points from a year ago. These are the most efficient distribution channels in our ecosystem, and we expect to see these trends continue into the fourth quarter and beyond. Looking forward, our Network and Travel Rewards program will continue to be the primary drivers and value for our customers and for American. And we are focused on operating our business as efficiently as possible. Our simplified fleet remains the youngest and most efficient among the U.S. Network carriers, and we are working to increase the utilization of both our mainline and regional aircraft. In addition, we are identifying opportunities to drive incremental value across the company. These initiatives and our limited near and medium term CapEx requirements will allow us to continue to generate free cash flow that we can use to reinvest in the business and continue to pay down debt. Now turning to our operation. The American Airlines team delivered another quarter of fantastic operational results. Our team has produced stellar results for more than a year, including a record-setting performance during the peak travel period this summer. American operated more than 515,000 flights in the third quarter, and we produced our best ever third quarter completion factor of 98.6%. American ended the quarter with the best completion factor of the U.S. network carriers, while maintaining our first place standing and on-time departures through the first nine months of the year. No network airline has operated more reliably than American over the past 15-months. Our operational performance is better than ever and it's because of our steadfast focus on reliability and strong execution in an increasingly complex environment. Our commercial and operations teams build a fantastic plan each month, we execute on it, and we recover quickly during irregular operations. We're building on our momentum and we are committed to delivering a reliable operation for our customers as we approach the holiday season. And now I'll turn it over to Devin to share more about our third quarter financial results and the outlook for the fourth quarter.\nDevon May: Thank you, Robert. I would also like to thank the team for delivering another outstanding quarter. During the third quarter, the average price of jet fuel increased sharply. While the rapid increase in fuel prices resulted in lower earnings in the quarter, we continue to stay focused on our priorities. As Robert mentioned, in the third quarter, we delivered a fantastic operation for our customers, we finalized a new contract for our pilots, and we took further action to strengthen our balance sheet. Excluding net special items, we reported third quarter net income of $263 million, or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.38. This is above the high-end of our most recent guidance update, driven by slightly higher capacity and better ex-fuel unit cost performance in the quarter. American produced record third quarter revenue of approximately $13.5 billion. This revenue performance led to adjusted operating income of nearly $730 million, resulting in a third quarter adjusted operating margin of 5.4%. Our strong operational performance in the third quarter resulted in capacity that was 6.9% higher year-over-year at the high-end of our guidance range. Revenue for the quarter was in line with what we had shared in July and unit revenue was down 6.3% versus a historically strong 2022. Unit cost, excluding net special items and fuel, was up 3.3% year-over-year, nearly a point better than the low-end of our prior guidance range. This outcome was driven by higher capacity and some expenses that were pushed to the fourth quarter. Our significant fleet investments over the past decade allows for relatively modest aircraft CapEx this decade. Year-to-date, we have taken delivery of 17 mainline aircraft, and we expect four more aircraft to be delivered by year end, two narrow body aircraft deliveries have been delayed into 2024, so we now anticipate taking delivery of a total of 21 aircraft in 2023. All of our 2023 deliveries have been financed. Given the continuous supply chain challenges the OEMs are managing, we have been in the used market for younger vintage narrowbody aircraft. We have signed an agreement with Alaska Airlines to purchase 10 Airbus A321neo aircraft that we expect to join fleet in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2024. Our 2023 aircraft CapEx is now expected to be approximately $1.9 billion, which includes a portion of the Alaska A321neo deliveries. Our 2023 non-aircraft CapEx is still expected to be approximately $800 million. We anticipate our 2024 total CapEx to be between $3 billion and $3.3 billion, slightly below our prior guide as we finalize our 2024 delivery schedules. Looking beyond 2024, we continue to review our medium and long-term fleet needs, and we are currently engaged with Boeing and Airbus for narrow-body aircraft deliveries in the latter half of this decade and beyond. Due to the young age of our fleet, we do not have any planned aircraft retirements this decade. As a result, we continue to expect aircraft CapEx to average approximately $3.5 billion per year through 2030. We are very pleased to have built our fleet in a low interest rate environment and at a time when the supply chain wasn't as challenged as it is today. Our relatively low capital requirements, along with our free cash flow production, has allowed for significant progress in strengthening the balance sheet. We've now reduced total debt by approximately $10.9 billion from peak levels in 2021, and we're more than 70% of the way to our goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. By year-end, we expect to have paid down approximately $11.5 billion, and we'll be 77% of the way to our total debt reduction goal. In addition to paying down regularly scheduled debt year-to-date we have proactively decreased our 2025 maturities by $2.3 billion through both the refinancing of the $1.8 billion South American term loan in the first quarter and more than $550 million of open market repurchases over the past two quarters. All three credit rating agencies recognize our progress with upgrades in the third quarter, and we expect further ratings improvements in the coming years as we continue to reduce total debt levels. We ended the third quarter with approximately $13.5 billion of total available liquidity, and for the full-year, we now expect free cash flow to approach $2 billion. The reduction from our prior free cash flow estimate is due to slightly higher aircraft CapEx related to the Alaska A321 and lower earnings largely due to the recent run-up in fuel expense. Now, on to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Post-Labor Day bookings have been in line with expectations. We have seen steady improvement in business travel with encouraging signs from both managed and unmanaged corporate customers, strong international demand, and historically high premium revenue both domestically and internationally. Consistent with recent trends, we expect steady demand during the upcoming peak holiday travel season. However, the strong unit revenue environment in 2022 continues to be a difficult comparison. As a result, we expect fourth quarter TRASM to be down 5.5% to 7.5% on 4.5% to 6.5% more capacity year-over-year. We expect fourth quarter CASM-ex to be up 5% to 7% year-over-year. This step up in sequential year-over-year CASM-ex is driven by the shift of some expenses from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and less year-over-year capacity growth. Our full-year CASM-ex guide remains unchanged, up approximately 3% versus 2022. Our current forecast for the fourth quarter assumes a fuel price of between $3.01 and $3.11 per gallon. Based on our current demand assumptions and fuel price forecast, we expect to produce an adjusted operating margin of between 2% and 4% in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our full-year capacity to be up approximately 6.5% versus 2022. Our full-year forecast for TRASM is to be up approximately 1% year-over-year, and as I just mentioned, we expect our full-year CASM-ex to be up approximately 3% versus 2022. Our capacity, TRASM and CASM-ex expectations for the year are all consistent with the guidance we provided in January of this year. This result speaks to the planning, focus, and determination of our team. Based on our demand and fuel cost assumptions, we now expect to produce a full-year adjusted operating margin of approximately 7% and adjusted EPS of between $2.25 and $2.50. Looking ahead to 2024, we continue to expect our capacity to be up mid-single-digits year-over-year, largely driven by better overall asset utilization. Increases in capacity will be oriented to our strengths with our global partnerships complementing our own flying. In 2024, we will have the assets and resources to finally grow beyond our 2019 capacity levels, but we will be nimble and adjust capacity based on the fuel and demand environment we are operating in. We are pleased with the progress the American Airlines team has made in 2023, and we remain focused on delivering results and pursuing efficiencies to unlock additional value in 2024 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Robert for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Devin. We're incredibly proud of everything the American Airlines team has accomplished over the past 18 months. We told you we were going to focus on reliability, profitability, and strengthening our balance sheet, and we've done just that. American had a great summer and has run the most reliable operation of the U.S. network carriers over the past 15-months. We're consistently profitable and we've materially improved our balance sheet by reducing total debt by nearly $11 billion since 2021. We'll maintain that focus as we move through the fourth quarter and beyond. No matter the macroeconomic conditions we face or the variability of the operating environment, our team is intent on controlling what we can control over the short-term and setting our company up for success over the long run. I'm incredibly excited by what the future holds for American. Looking ahead, we will be much more efficient as an airline. As an example, even today, we could be flying 5% more with the aircraft we already have in our fleet. We're eager to restore regional service to the underserved smaller markets that are still feeling the effects of the pandemic. We're building back and expanding our network in an efficient manner that will lead to stronger revenue production. Our Travel Rewards Program AAdvantage has already undergone significant change that is helping us grow high margin revenue at a greater rate than GDP and we anticipate that to continue as we work to make our co-brand credit cards even more valuable to consumers and our partners. On top of all that, we continue to innovate in creating a leading retailing experience, ensuring that anything we offer our customers can be shopped, purchased, and serviced digitally. It all bodes well for American, our team members, customers, the communities we serve, and especially our investors as we enter 2024 and look to 2025 and beyond. And with that, operator, please open the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Helane Becker of TD Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. I'm not used to getting the first question. Thanks, guys. So here's my question. As you think about your hubs, you've talked about, Sue's talked in the past about New York and LA not really being profitable. You know, Philadelphia seems to me to be a good connecting hub. It looks like you're putting a lot of international capacity in the market. So it brings up a couple of points. One is, are there enough captains to handle what you're thinking of doing around the network? Charlotte and Dallas have gotten a lot of attention. What about some of your other markets like Philly, Chicago and maybe your coastal locations?\nRobert Isom: Hey Helene, let me start and Vasu can talk to you more about exactly where we're focusing our network and if we need some real expertise, David Seymour can step in. I'll start with this, we're really pleased that we were able to enter into a new agreement with the APA and our pilots back in August. It's a deal that, well, it certainly comes with increased compensation and benefits and expense, but it also is something that puts it in a position where we can train our pilots in a much more efficient manner and more quickly. So one of the issues with getting our fleet fully back restored has been just our ability to move pilots through the schoolhouse. But right now, with some of the changes we've made in the contract, we have much more flexibility to actually grow the airline as we need. And so I don't see any issues with being able to support our fleet as we get into 2024 from a mainline perspective. On the regional side of the world, that is something that we're still working through. We've seen a lot of nice progress, but we're not fully restored. As we look into 2024, you'll see us do some things that I think that will hasten the progress to get our aircraft back up. And from a regional perspective, it's really not a pilot supply issue at this point. It's more of an issue of having first officers with the amount of time, the thousand hours that they need to graduate from right seat to left seat. And I'm encouraged by what I see on that front. So Vasu, what about -- how are we focused in the network?\nVasu Raja: Yes, look, just building off of Robert's comments in the opening remarks, as we look forward, we think we have a lot of opportunity there. Our hubs and really all of our hubs, but especially our four of our largest and potentially highest capacity hubs in Phoenix, Dallas, Charlotte, and Miami are located near what are starting to turn out to be some of the most economically resilient markets there are. And we still have opportunity to go bring back more fleet, and we have infrastructure in those places to grow further. And as we see the future unfolding, to your point, Helene, we actually see a lot of opportunities to go and grow the performance of the coastal markets and Philadelphia and Chicago specifically in a way that's really complimentary to that.\nHelane Becker: Okay, and then just for my follow-up question on the domestic side, if I look at your numbers versus your two major competitors you seem to be decelerating. And I'm just kind of wondering if that's just a function of the size of the aircraft you're flying, not having as many premium seats, or is it just the markets that you're in? Although given what Vasu, you just said, it seems like the demand in those markets should still be pretty reasonable?\nVasu Raja: Yes, Helene, actually it's none of the above would be the answer to the question. Look in the business of ours from one quarter to another, it's easy to draw a lot of prognostications, which probably aren't there. And as we see it right now, it's a particularly weird time. One, because so many -- so much of the U.S. airline business is still recovering their networks, and the networks that are being recovered are probably never been more divergent, never more different competitively, but also never more different than what was there three or four, certainly five years ago. And so a little bit of what you see is that. And what I would actually say is we, I'll echo the points I made and then Robert made me in the opening bit. As we look forward, actually we see a lot of opportunity. First of all, with our network, you know, as we look out there, we serve 300 cities in North America, in 200 of them, we have a network advantage. And as we bring back more of the regional jets, as we up gauge the mainline fleet, that's a real advantage for us, because so many of our competitors really won't be there. The customers in those cities are about 50% of our customer base, but they produce about 60% of our revenues. They're the ones who are signing up for the program for AAdvantage and enrolling in the card. And then the other big opportunity we have really across our enterprise, but it'll play out most notably in the domestic system, is really with AAdvantage, our travel rewards program. As we see it, our co-branded credit card is the largest co-branded credit card in circulation. Our program is one [Technical Difficulty] maybe travel programs in the business. But if you look at us, we produce probably $400 million less in frequent flyer revenue than what the industry leader does right now. So the quarter-to-quarter trends are just a function of things like the recovery. The real thing that we're seeing is the opportunity in the quarters and years ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning guys. So Devon, can you help try to shape the cost outlook and the cadence by quarter for 2024, or at least talk to some of the headwinds out there? I know it's going to be pretty noisy just given the way the labor costs have layered in. Can you kind of help us think about 2024 CASM-ex, sort of, headwinds in relation to the higher level of CASM-ex that you're expecting now in fourth quarter?\nDevon May: Sure, and maybe I'll just start with fourth quarter performance and then we'll talk a little bit about 2024. And while we're not giving CASM guidance for the year, I can talk to you about some headwinds and tailwinds. So starting with fourth quarter of this year, as Vasu said, these numbers do shift around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter, but our full-year CASM-ex guide has been unchanged since the start of the year. And we knew at the start of the year, the fourth quarter was going to be our toughest comp. Our capacity starts to decelerate or capacity growth starts to decelerate a little bit as we entered the fourth quarter. We also had a couple of one-time credits that we got in the fourth quarter of 2022 that aren't happening for us this year. And then there was a shift of some expenses from the third quarter into the fourth quarter, adding a little bit more pressure. But we're still really pleased with our full-year result, hitting the guide or the midpoint of the guide that we had at the very start of the year. As we look out to 2024, the headwinds are where you'd expect. It's largely around salaries and benefits. We have open contracts with our flight attendants and our passenger service and reservations groups. If we are able to achieve deals that match industry leaders for those work groups, it'll add about a point of CASM pressure year-over-year. We also just have regular increases for other labor groups that are happening next year. But the tailwinds of what Robert talked about and what we're excited about actually working towards full utilization of our fleet. And this operation we've been running has been incredible for the last year, year and a half. Now we have a real opportunity to go ahead and do some optimization work around this operation. So we do have some headwinds on salaries and benefits. We have some real nice tailwinds as well into 2024, and we'll be able to provide more guidance on what CASM will look like on a January call.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. Thank you for that. And then, Robert or Vasu, maybe -- there's a lot of talk right now in the industry about how segmentation premium products are changing the structure of the industry, maybe to the detriment of domestic oriented or discount carriers. Can you add your thoughts on this topic here and talk a little bit about how you see American playing in this evolving structure? We didn't hear a lot about premium and any of the prepared remarks today. I'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about, you know, what some people are calling a seismic change in the industry dynamic.\nVasu Raja: Sure, this is Vasu. I can answer that. In fact, I'd be very, very happy to answer it. Look, what we see, and we think that the real causal thing that's happening in the customer itself as opposed to a their product or cabinet service, what we've certainly seen and Robert alluded to it since 2019 advantage -- our advantage customers are really driving the revenue production of the company, and that's manifesting itself in a range of ways. So versus \u201819, our membership is up 50%. Almost two-thirds of our revenue, certainly in this last quarter, came from AAdvantage customers. And what we're finding with them is that those customers are proving to be a much more resilient pool of demand that indeed are willing to engage in behaviors that aren't just shopping for the fastest schedule or the cheapest price. We see that play out in a lot of different ways. One is premium cabin performance, where our premium fair products revenue is up 7% from AAdvantage customers, in keeping with our overall seed growth. Two, we see that remuneration on our credit cards is of about 25% from these customers. And then importantly, we find that these customers disproportionately want to shop with us directly about 85% of all the AAdvantage member revenue in the system is coming through our direct channels. So we see the causal thing, and that's why it was in our remarks, is what's really happening is for our AAdvantage members, there's a real desire to travel, and they're coming to us because they want a great network and a program that rewards them for using it, delivered reliably over and over and over again.\nRobert Isom: Hey, and David, I just want to add one thing to that. It's look, we're going to be part of and also a driver of premium revenue growth. So one of the things I think is noteworthy, our premium seeding is going to grow by 43% between now and 2026. And that's as a result of bringing on the new XLR and reconfiguring our 777 300s and actually taking a look at even some of the domestic fleet as well, where I know that we'll be adding more first-class product, or at least reconfiguring to that end. And on that same front, we're really pleased with our regional aircraft. On that front, you take a look at the E175 and they have fantastic cabins that are every bid is nice and appreciated by customers is anything we fly in the mainline side. So I look forward to participating in driving what's going to be going on in terms of premium products.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, good morning, everyone. Devon, maybe just digging into the 2024 costs a little bit. Given the changes in the pilot contract, I know kind of the new profit sharing now runs through the salaries and wages line. How should we think about wage growth next year in relation to kind of the single-digit capacity?\nDevon May: Hey, we'll give more guidance on 2024 as we [Technical Difficulty] salaries and benefits is an area we're going to see some pressure there. As I just mentioned, we do have this open agreement with our flight attendants and our passenger service and reservations agents that we hope to get closed and we hope to be able to match industry leading contracts there, which will drive about a point of growth. And as we get into the year, there will be some lumpiness on year-over-year comps. In the first quarter of 2023, we didn't have an accrual for our pilot agreement. So we'll see a little more cost pressure in the first quarter. But as we get into the last three quarters of the year, that cost pressure is going to ease. And then these efficiencies that we've been talking about, I think, are going to add some nice tailwinds as we go through the year. So let us get back to you in January with a little bit more detail, but that's kind of where we're seeing it right now.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Thank you. And then [Indiscernible] Vasu maybe -- can you speak a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing on the corporate side, particularly as it relates to both kind of large and small corporates, particularly, I know you've made some pretty big changes with your corporate sales force just curious if you've seen any sort of unexpected share shifts or anything like that as we moved into this more seasonally stronger time period for corporate travel? Thanks.\nVasu Raja: Yes. Hi, thank you Andrew. It\u2019s another question which I don't know if people might have happy to happy to address and that I'll do it in this fashion. We have made a number of changes with our selling and distribution strategy, the purpose of which is very simple. Our customers have been telling us for a very long time now that they want it so that anything that we offer them can be shopped, sold, and serviced digitally. And we've been seeing that customer sentiment for a really long time. And that's what we're out to serve. And our strategy is this simple. In order to go make that happen, we need to distribute our product exclusively through the internet. And that's what you're seeing from us. We're shifting content, bare products, schedules, things like that, out of legacy technology where we can't provide customers the kind of shopping and service experience they expect, and we're putting it through technologies that can. And on that journey, we've certainly invited all of our retailers to come along with it, but that is a different world than what was there before. And what we've seen before is really encouraging, actually. In the quarter, our total business revenues were up 2%. We actually performed better year-over-year among contracted corporations than we had in a number of months prior to it. But very importantly, our cost of sale is down 13%. So we're finding that we're able to generate more revenues through less cost of sale, which is very encouraging to us. And like I said, as we go forward, we intend to continue the momentum that we've got. We certainly invite any retailing partner to join us along the journey. And in fact, most recently, we launched a new business program called AAdvantage Business. And AAdvantage is very much the platform upon which we will build all of our commercial programs. But through that -- through AAdvantage business, companies of all sizes can access our content in a way that's cheaper, simpler, better servicing, and in a way that's more rewarding for travelers. We'll accelerate their status. So we're actually really encouraged by what we've seen, encouraged by its revenue production, and look forward to continuing the momentum.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good morning everyone. Hey, Vasu, can I just -- I know you\u2019ve sort of called out what the revenue for premium for AAdvantage members was up year-over-year? If I look at in its entirety what year-over-year was the gain in premium product revenue. And then when we think about sort of the split, where are you, you know, as a percent of your passenger revenue, total passenger revenue, premium versus non-premium? Even rough numbers would be fine. Thanks. Hello?\nVasu Raja: Sorry, Mike. Shame on me. My microphone wasn't on. But I'll repeat, I'll answer the first question first. Indeed, premium cabin revenues are up across our system, about 6% to 7%.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nVasu Raja: By AAdvantage members whose revenue is up about 7%. Non-members are up about 5%. And then to your question [Technical Difficulty] about customer base. Look, one of the things that we've certainly noticed is probably more importantly than segmenting based on fair products is by the customers themselves. And so what we do is we look at customers who are buying non-premium products. Those are fairs that are not eligible for discounts, mileage earn, things like that, are lowest selling products. And we look at it for customers who are non-advantaged customers, who tend to be our most transitory customers. And we find is that transitory customers buying our lowest selling fares is about 30% of our system revenue. The other 70% is customers, who are buying premium quality fares. And that number is disproportionately weighted to advantage customers.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just my Second question on, you know, I saw that you're applying for -- to fly from JFK, Haneda. And I'm curious because, you know, sort of post-NEA, I got the sense that maybe you were going to be sort of maybe, I don't know if downsizing New York is the right thing, but the fact is, you know, wide bodies are scarce and for everyone. And that would take two frames. And you already have JAL in that market with the code shares. So, you know, what's the rationale behind that? Thanks for taking my questions.\nVasu Raja: Yes. Hey, thanks, Mike. And I'll answer through the lens of New York, which I know is probably on a lot of our investors' minds. And I'll answer the Haneda question as part of it. At the time pre-COVID and certainly prior to the NEA, American Airlines had a really fundamental problem in New York, which is we were losing our relevance to New York city originating customers. Every year we had declining originating share, our AAdvantage enrollments were declining year-after-year, simply because we didn't have a slot portfolio to compete with the two largest ones. And that was the reasons behind doing the NEA. Now in these last several weeks and months, what we've noticed is actually the New York originating customer has changed what they demand. Same day business trips are down a lot. There's way fewer people originating New York, who are looking to take day trips to Boston or Chicago or Detroit. But that New York city customer is much more interested in flying long haul, internationally long haul, to the west coast [Technical Difficulty] market in Florida. That's a thing that our slot portfolio is much more built to do. And in the last few weeks since the NEA has been terminated, actually what we've seen is that our originating share is stable. New York city can be the number one market in our system both for AAdvantage enrollments and for credit card signups and penetration. So we're encouraged by that and you see that. The last thing I'll mention about it is through our global partnerships we're able to offer a thing in New York which is very unique both in our TA facility and also being able to go and operate our major partners -- major complexes whether that's Heathrow or Haneda or Doha for that matter.\nMichael Linenberg: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. Devon, I just wanted to dig in a bit on the cost performance to-date. You know, you came in close to a point below the low end of your 3Q range. I know you mentioned some timing shift, but you're also sticking with your prior midpoint for full-year CASM-ex despite the extra crew for pilot retro pay since you last updated that full-year cost outlook? I guess, you know, what has been going better than expected? And then can you just remind us what you had originally baked in for the open flight tenant contract in the second-half did that have any impact on 3Q? Thanks.\nRobert Isom: Hey, thanks for the question Catie. We do have it's largely timing and operational performance with higher ASMs is what benefited us in the third quarter. In our prior guidance, we didn't have anything in the third quarter for our open labor agreements outside of the pilots. We did have something in the fourth quarter and we still have something modest in the fourth quarter just given the time it would take to reach and ratify an agreement. But generally speaking, everything this year has come in very much in line with what our initial guidance was, which is why for the full-year, we're still right around that 3% number. We've seen a little bit of pressure on certain line items. We've gotten some benefits from others, but overall it's largely in line with our expectations. And like just generally speaking, we are pretty good at forecasting out expenses. And I think during the COVID years, that became a little bit more challenging. But in 2023, we feel pretty good about our ability to forecast and deliver results.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. Thanks for the detail. And then maybe one for Vasu. You know between the third quarter and second quarter you experienced decel in TRASM, you know, on year-over-year in 2019. I totally understand there's so many moving pieces now as the network recovers and the shape of your network has changed a bit over the years. But your fourth quarter guidance implies things will stabilize in a year-over-year basis. Can you just walk us through what's driving that stabilization? Thanks so much.\nRobert Isom: And for my clarity, you mean the quarter-to-quarter stabilization?\nCatherine O'Brien: Right, just comparing the year-over-year to each other.\nRobert Isom: Sure. I will do my best. There's a few things that are changing in our system right now between one quarter to the next that has that effect. In Q3, what we find just in terms of how we brought the network back, a lot of what we were flying were off time periods, like off peak flights. As we get into Q4, that starts to stabilize a little bit more. We regain a lot more regional supportability into the fourth quarter. And so a little bit of what you see there are just shifting year-over-year trends based on how we brought the airline back and then where the airline is oriented around flying. In the third quarter, especially in the trough seasons of August and September, there are some strange year-over-year comps where the Northeast was performing better than markets in the Sunbelt, when we get into Q4, that's when the Sunbelt and short haul MCLA starts to change. And you see that in our schedules. We have, I think, our biggest Miami operation in our history there. So a lot of what you see there is less a function of something fundamental, but some really unique quarter-to-quarter recovery trends.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. Vasu in NEA question, you know, we're obviously tracking some of the rebalancing between JFK and Philadelphia. I see that 787 captains in Philly, that number is moving up quite a bit. Looks like JetBlue will continue to operate a portion of your slots through the end of IATA's summer season next year. I [Technical Difficulty] so part of my question is am I right on that, but more importantly I recognize networks are fluid, but when should we think about Philadelphia and New York, sort of, reaching a steady state? Is that a process that will wrap in time for next summer or should we think of the NEA unwind as lasting longer than that?\nVasu Raja: Hey Jamie, Thanks for the question. I guess, we\u2019ve all been around this business for a while and steady state is always a very difficult thing to prognosticate. But I will say this, the role of these hubs is quite complimentary. And we're seeing it more and more per my comments earlier, where New York is a lot of New York originating customers when it goes international. Domestic, it's a mix of New York originating, and as we call it, Spoke City, like outside of hubs originating into New York. And Philadelphia is our largest connecting complex into transatlantic. And so a lot of what you see is just, it comes back to what Robert mentioned. We're seeing actually a lot of traction in international and transatlantic, better than we have before. We're seeing it from both of these markets. For the first time since our Atlantic joint venture was created, we're pretty consistently the unit revenue leader amongst the group, which has been very unique and a long time coming. And so we think that these two hubs are very complimentary. We see it every day that they're very complimentary as we bring in the XLR that enables us to do some really unique things in both of those markets. And as we do things like improve the configuration on the 777 300 or bring in more 787 9s, that further augments that. So that's what you see and look in the world of network planning, we can move things around based on where the demand is. We'll continue to do it. There will be some of that rebalancing. And certainly as we go into next year, we do see a lot of opportunity to bulk up in Philadelphia as we get more supportability back, as the regional comes back, as we take wide body deliveries.\nJamie Baker: Okay, fair enough. And then second question, you know, for Devon, a clarification, the $3.5 billion CapEx figures that you gave or figure that you gave before, that was aircraft only, correct? So all in, we should be dialing in something, you know, closer to $4.5 billion going forward. I'm assuming I got that right. And if so, do you expect to generate cash next year at current fuel prices?\nDevon May: Yes, so there\u2019s two separate things. So for 2024, our total CapEx is between $3 billion and $3.3 billion. Long-term beyond 2024, you're right that the $3.5 billion number I gave was just aircraft CapEx. So for \u201824, I think our capital requirements are such that we certainly have the ability to generate free cash flow. And we're absolutely in a different position than some of our peers, just given where they are at in terms of fleet renewal program versus where we're at. We spent over $30 billion from 2014 to 2019 on our fleet renewal. Now we're in a nice spot where capital requirements are slightly less and it does give us the ability to produce free cash flow going forward like we did in this year.\nJamie Baker: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the time. Kind of an industry question, but we'll go ahead and ask it of you. Just with respect to 4Q RASM guidance down 6.5% at the midpoint, which is actually a little bit better than what we were modeling, and the cost pressures you are outlining into next year, what needs to go right to get that unit revenue back to positive territory. I mean, the 5% growth that you're outlining, you know, may or may not be crazy relative to GDP. If we're just thinking about it year-over-year, right, 5% doesn't sound crazy. But if we think about where your margins are exiting here, the exit rate on your margins, you know, any thoughts about how we get back to positive RASM, which it appears you'll need to stabilize your margins here? Appreciate the thoughts.\nRobert Isom: Hey, thanks for the question. Look, and the answer is both very simple and consistent with the stuff we've been saying. What we get to do is, the stuff we have to do is within our control. It's bringing back our regional jet network, which creates a lot of revenue benefits for us and a lot of unique markets for our customers. And two, it's growing the revenues from AAdvantage, both through our brand of credit cards and how we go issue and enable the redemption of miles. Both of those things are tops on our plans for next year. We're excited to go and execute on that. And we see a lot of upside.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I guess just maybe thinking sequentially, like how patient will you be with sort of breakeven-ish, negative margins? Like is that a one or two quarter phenomenon? Is it a multi-year phenomenon?\nDevon May: Hey, Vasu, I'll take this. Hey, Duane, thanks. Look, we are going to be incredibly focused on making sure that we deploy assets where we can make money. The kind of things that we're talking about and focusing on our strengths are where we see that happening. And look, I think that we, you know, to the contrary, I think we carry momentum in a lot of the work that we've done this year that that Vasu has been at the center of in terms of making sure that we have the best network and we can sell, shop sell and service it digitally, is all groundwork for next year. And so as we take a look at not only the regional network, further enhancing premium product, what we will intend to do with AAdvantage and less variable revenue. I think that all plays into a lot of strength. And on top of that, look, we're in the midst of recovery still. And so as we go from quarter-to-quarter, we know that there are things that we could have done differently, you know, over the past summer that we're going to make sure that we're addressing in terms of where we're flying and how we're doing it, but we will have very little tolerance for what you would consider, kind of, investment or development flying. We're going to fly where we make money.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: No, it's not an easy question, but I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the time. Just your capacity has been pretty stable relative to the industry. And a lot of the constraints that we've talked about this year seem like they're going to carry forward next year if not get a little bit worse. And so, at the same time, the domestic competitors are really struggling. So I'm just curious on how you may take AAdvantage of that situation next year, if those themes continue to play out, or are you just happy with the current execution of what you're doing right now?\nRobert Isom: No, no, I'll start, Conor and Vasu can join in. Look, you know, when we talk about the kind of capacity that we are going to be putting back, we've described it over and over again. I think that, you know, first off, we've got assets that on hand today that provide some of that benefit. We're certainly going to make sure that, that gets deployed in a fashion that is productive. I do think that there are constraints out there that continue on and whether that's ATC or it's some of the supply chain, both engines and air framers, I think that, that kind of stuff is we're going to have to work through. And then on top of that, look, we're all getting through the pilot shortfalls as well. So there's ups and downs to that. But overall, you will see us, we're going to play our game. And that means find our Sunbelt hubs, strengthening the rest of our network through getting capacity back up in the air, and doing all the things that Vasu has talked about in terms of taking advantage of AAdvantage and our co-brand deals and then also modern retailing.\nConor Cunningham: Okay and then you know you've executed you know, pretty remarkably on your plan, but your margins, maybe to Helane\u2019s earlier question, just, you know, continue to lag Delta United and, you know, your operations been better, all that stuff, and I get it, but, you know, When you think about the opportunity ahead to close that gap, is it more a revenue equation or cost? I think historically Americans talked a little bit about the revenue gap, but it seems to be that there's more of a cost opportunity here. Just curious on your thoughts there. Thank you.\nDevon May: Hey, Conor, it's Devon. I'll take that. And certainly, this isn't something we look at a quarterly basis, but we do spend a lot of time on benchmarking. And if you want to talk about benchmarking margins, we do think it's important to look at it and look at it on a 12-month basis and the right margin to be using when you're comparing us to these other network peers, is EBITDAR, because it just takes out financing decisions, so aircraft rent versus depreciation and interest expense, and it takes out capital structure, which we just know right now, we have a difference, but that's an area we also know we're going to improve on going forward. So let's talk about that. On EBITDAR margins, I think we stack up really well with our competitors. If you look at 12 months ended third quarter, I think we're right on top of one of them and maybe there's a small gap to the other. But I think our progress versus 2019 has been really good. And the opportunity ahead is on both sides. I do think we're going to be able to produce capacity at lower unit costs going forward or at least decelerate this unit cost growth. And I do think we have top line opportunities as well. And then the only other thing I'd close on is, well, I think we're in pretty nice shape on margins. And there's opportunity ahead. When it comes to free cash flow, I think we are unique amongst our network peers with our capital requirements going forward, and we should be able to outproduce on free cash flow for most of this decade.\nRobert Isom: And Conor, I'll just underscore one more time. Please take a look at the past year. There's a lot of variability in quarters in terms of whose network is aligned to do better one to the next. And also, a lot of noise in the numbers in terms of just building back the airlines from the pandemic. We feel really confident about how we're seeing '24 especially on a competitive basis against our peers.\nConor Cunningham: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning, everyone. I was kind of curious if you could provide a little color on the international indices. I know you mentioned in transatlantic is really strong. It seems like LatAm is a little bit weak in what that is. And along those lines, when you're talking about going into your strength, do you mean next year, kind of most of the growth will be domestic and not as much in international?\nVasu Raja: Yes. Hey Savi, this is Vasu. I can take that, and I'll take it in two parts. First, just around the world, yes, we see really strong long-haul revenue trends, regardless of the entity, long-haul Atlantic, long-haul Latin America, long-haul Pacific and as I mentioned earlier, versus any prior period of time, whether last year 2019 or really anything as far back as it goes we've seen uniquely strong revenue performance. But what we're encouraged by is that our revenue performance, though it's not where we yet wish it to be, has never grown at a faster rate than some of our international partners. And for many of them, fly into North America is the very best thing that they do. So we're encouraged by the journey we've been on we see more opportunity ahead as we do simple things. Configure airplanes smartly, get low-cost jets like the XLR. And so our future in international is one which is well within our control and very practical. It doesn't involve any great prognostications of how the world would change. And then as far as next year goes, look, a lot of our overall entity mix is largely to be similar, where we're going to be about a 70%, 75% short-haul carrier and a 20% to 25% long-haul carrier. But those areas would grow at a similar rate, which is why the mix stays on.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And if I might, just next year's growth should we assume a lot more kind of regional like a mix next year just as that regional entity comes back versus mainline as we kind of think through maybe what the pressures on CASM might be, but maybe the kind of the benefits to RASM?\nDevon May: Yes. It's probably a little early to get into too much detail. We do expect to build back the regional network. We're also looking at better utilization on the mainline side. So we'll give a little more detail as we get into January.\nSavi Syth: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel McKenzie of Seaport Global.\nDaniel McKenzie: Oh, hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to see if I could put a bigger spotlight on the distribution strategy. So I guess, Vasu, building on the prior remarks around direct distribution, what percent of Americans revenue has now shifted to direct channels versus, say, a year ago? How big a change has that been what is it that American can do today that it couldn't do before? And then finally, if you can just help us frame what that revenue upside means, not just today, but more importantly, for those investors that invest longer term, what that revenue contribution could look like, say, three years from now?\nVasu Raja: Hey Dan, I appreciate the question, and I'll do that be your answer sequentially, too. Look, first and foremost, like I said, we're very encouraged by the changes that we've got there, largely, because they're simply responsive to the customers. And we're retailing our product the way customers expect, which is really just through the Internet. And unsurprisingly, customers have responded. So what we saw as we were going through COVID, was already without American Airlines making any strategic changes, we went from about selling 50% direct to selling about 60% direct and right now, what we're in taking in terms of revenue is actually about 80% going through, as we call it, Internet-based distribution, of which about 70 of those 80 points is going through our true direct channels .com and app and the balance coming through new distribution technologies. In fact, our Internet-based travel agency technologies is now a bigger source of bookings than any of the legacy global distribution systems are. So we're encouraged by that, but also very clearly not that surprised. I mean customers want that experience, which is the second part of your question. The very simple benefit is through what we do, we can go and create more offers for customers that they value. We've seen this, and we continue to see this at a number of customers who come to aa.com or the app shopping for the cheapest fare that we have end up selling up, like roughly 70% of the customers who come to our websites actually come looking for the lowest fare, but buy something higher than that. And through these new tools, we can go and offer them a whole lot more that creates value for them. We can differentiate things like how they're able to redeem miles for different fare products or even they're able to earn miles for different fair products. And then the other thing that I would say is, which is we're finding to be very, very impactful. And as we shift to Internet-based distribution, our servicing becomes a whole lot simpler. So it's hard to do what three years out look like. Looks like, but I can talk about the next several weeks and quarters. And what you will see from us are things where we do much more consciously differentiate. All the content we offer will be through Internet-based technologies. We will look to do things like offering more miles for buying premium cabin for shopping through our direct channels for using our credit card. We will create more redemption opportunities for the [Technical Difficulty] but then also, what will be in place by the end of this year is that 100% of what we sell will be able to be serviced digitally but only through Internet-based technologies. That's the thing which is hugely impactful to our customers. For any of you, if you're traveling on American Airlines, I encourage you if you're making changes, please use the app to do so. I think you'll find it to be a much better experience in times past and an industry-leading one as well.\nDaniel McKenzie: Very good. Okay. Second question here for Devon. I know Robert shared that 75% of the debt is at a fixed rate. But just given the higher for longer interest rate regime today, how is that changing the way you think about the three-year balance sheet targets and goals? And can American get to an investment-grade rating at some point -- and what might a realistic time frame look like to get there?\nDevon May: Well, I'll just start with right now, our focus on the balance sheet has been really on 2025. And our stated goal is that we are going to reduce $15 billion in total debt by the end of 2025. We still expect to do that at this point. And we think if we get there, that gets us to a BB credit. Beyond 2025, we'll see where it goes. But right now, we're focused on the next couple of years.\nDaniel McKenzie: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I had two quick questions. First is, when do you expect to start getting the XLR? My second question is, you mentioned that domestic demand is steady, but I wanted to see if you could be more specific on that. Like how it's increasing into the fourth quarter toward the winter holidays. Also wondering if on international demand, if you've seen the level of demand that's normally like a summer peak level, has that continued past October and through the end of the year like some of the other international carriers have said?\nDevon May: Hey, it\u2019s Devon. I'll just start on the XLR and then hand over to Sue. We expect our first XLR delivery to come late next year, and then the order stream starts to really pick up in 2025 and 2026.\nVasu Raja: Yes. And hey Mary, I think that probably the best way to answer your question is kind of taking a long view look at it. And as we look at just overall demand in our system versus 2019, we're seeing like revenue production, which could be 15%, 20% higher than what was there before. That's across the industry, but for American Airlines specifically. So when you extract yourself from like the year-over-year, quarter-to-quarter changes, what you do see is that demand for travel is materially larger. In the airline capacity is starting to catch up to what that is, but that's our reasons for saying that we see a lot of -- we see domestic on a similar demand trend line as what's been out there, and we certainly see that as we're anticipating characteristically strong peak periods. And then as far as long-haul international goes, yes, we do continue to see strength in Q4. A lot of it is -- domestic was a marketplace that for customers opened up a lot sooner and a lot more completely and comprehensive than what many of these. Many countries outside of the U.S. did. So we're still in a period where some of that demand is coming back. And we, as many are beneficiaries of that.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thanks a lot, Vasu. Can you just be more specific in terms of the upcoming demand domestically for the holiday period? I mean really, I don't think there's a lot of interest now in what the comparisons are to 2019. Just are you seeing higher demand going into the holidays that you normally would? Is it slower when you say steady, that doesn't give a necessarily very good impression in terms of what your holiday demand is.\nVasu Raja: Well, look, Mary, in our holidays, we routinely have far more demand than we have seats for whether you want to compare it to 2022, 2021, 2019 or probably 2009. So we're in a place right now where actually our holidays are very lightly booked because we know any time we create more availability in the holidays, the seats go very quickly. So we are anticipating continued like year-over-year improvement in holiday performance. What we have been seeing in things like the days around the big peak periods also are stronger on a year-over-year booking basis, too. But still, we are in a place where the entire month of November is less than 40% booked for American Airlines. And that's deliberate because we're anticipating really a lot of the continued strength around peaks.\nMary Schlangenstein: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Apologies. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Yes, thank you. I was curious if the latest spirit issues with Boeing are impacting American at all if you're expecting any kind of delays and if those will affect schedules and plans at all?\nRobert Isom: Yes. Ali, thanks for that. Look, we work closely with Boeing. And I have to tell you that the Boeing team has been really, really forthcoming and cooperative with us. Certainly, they have some issues with supply chain, and they're working with us on our order book. We probably anticipate seeing a little bit of slippage as we go into next year but it's not something that is going to have a material impact on our capacity, and we're working very closely with Boeing on that. So thanks for that question.\nAlison Sider: Thank you. And then I guess on pilots, some other airlines and unions have talked about kind of like an unusual maybe reluctance for pilots -- first off, there's upgrade the Captain, maybe more quality of life issues coming up. Are you guys seeing that at all?\nRobert Isom: I'll ask David Seymour, our Chief Operating Officer, to comment?\nDavid Seymour: Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Ali. I think you're probably focusing on the regional operations where there -- first off, I think probably the bigger constraint we have is them getting the hours to be able to upgrade to captain. But we're not seeing any reluctance really overall that first officers don't want to upgrade to captain.\nRobert Isom: Yes. And hey David, remind me, for same aircraft type, when we see first officers upgrading from the FO position to capital position, the compensation increases roughly 35%, 40%.\nDavid Seymour: That's correct, yes.\nRobert Isom: Yes. So there's a strong incentive to become a captain at American Airlines.\nAlison Sider: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexandra Scores of Dallas Morning News.\nAlexandra Scores: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question, I wanted to ask about station and how that's impacting American customers? And then my second question is what you're seeing in that same vein, looking ahead to the winter travel season?\nVasu Raja: Sorry, we didn't hear you super well in the room. Would you say emissions.\nAlexandra Scores: Inflation, sorry.\nVasu Raja: Inflation. Got it. Okay. Yes, look, right now, I'll say this. Air as I've said on a couple of these calls, air travel remains an amazing bargain, though indeed, the price of gas or groceries or clothing or anything is up quite a lot. Air travel is not up nearly as much. In fact, I think today, in the fall, you can fly to Las Vegas for less than $50. And my guess is just about any place you go to eat, it would cost you more to eat there. So we have yet to see something where inflation is a thing that we could go point to as a causal headwind to demand.\nAlexandra Scores: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, good morning. We've been seeing a lot of discounts, a lot of double-digit fares from you guys midweek anytime. Can you talk a little bit about how much have you had to discount this fall kind of coming off of the peak summer season to fill planes? And how confident are you in this breakeven guide just considering where fuel is now and whether you can drum up fair enough to cover that. Thanks.\nVasu Raja: I'll answer the first part of it by just simply saying that we don't really comment on fare activity or sale activity for any number of reasons. But I think others can talk a little bit more about kind of margin performance.\nDevon May: Yes, our fourth quarter guide, we've done it the same way we've done for all the other quarters and throughout the year. We have confidence in our revenue guide. We provide a range on it. We have a lot of confidence in our cost guide and fuel remains volatile, but we did put a range on that as well. So as it sits today, we feel really good about what we have out there for our Q4 guy.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. And then, I mean, I guess if you can't comment on fares, but are you losing any pricing power broadly compared with last year or even compared with competitors now?\nVasu Raja: Well, that's probably an inadvertent way to comment on fares. And look, what we continue to see is a lot of the same overall demand trend sequentially day-to-day, week-to-week, et cetera. And as I mentioned, air travel remains an amazing bargain for customers. And customers, as we've seen for several years, are keen to travel and traveling at a greater rate than what they were in 2019.\nLeslie Josephs: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone. I'll close with this. There's obviously a lot of short-term sentiment in thinking out there. And we understand why. There's a lot going on in the world today. That said, the airline business is one that absolutely requires long-term thinking as we navigate -- even as we navigate shorter-term variability. The aircraft we buy today are going to be around for 20-years plus. The leases we signed at airports and the hundreds of millions and billions of dollars that we commit to airports. Those are leases that are 10 years plus in financings that go out a lot longer than that. And even the labor contracts that we sign are multiple years, 4 and 5 years. So we have to take that into account as we look to the future. And all of us at American have worked tirelessly to set the airline up for success in the short term, yet long-term world. So as we look to 2024 and beyond, look, we have an enviable fleet. We've gone out and spent $30 billion prior to the pandemic to put ourselves in a position where we are entering into capital spending that is lasting. And we're doing it in an environment where others are facing rising interest rates and issues with suppliers. So while there's a heading the other way, we're set up for success. And we look forward to putting all of our assets back to full utilization and we know we can optimize how we're running the airline as we go forward. And all of that is why we build the best network and work with our customers to make sure that they are rewarded for using it. So we've got a great baseline, and I'm very confident in the future of travel and demand. And I can't wait to talk to you more as we go out to the next quarter 2024 about where American is headed and the story we have to tell. So thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Scott Long, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.\nScott Long: Thank you, Atif. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the American Airlines Group second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call this morning with prepared remarks, we have our CEO, Robert Isom; and our CFO, Devon May, and a number of our other senior executives are also in the room for the Q&A session. Robert will start the call this morning with an overview of our performance. And Devon will follow with details on the second quarter and will outline our operating plans and outlook going forward. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions followed by questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Now before we begin today, we must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast of capacity and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information we're giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The summer is well underway, and the American Airlines team is firing on all cylinders. We continue to build on the strong foundation we have laid over the past year and remain focused on reliability, profitability, accountability and strengthening our balance sheet. That focus is showing up in our results. Everything we have said we would do at the start of the year, we have done. Our operation is performing at historically strong levels. And this morning, we reported adjusted pre-tax earnings of approximately $1.8 billion for the second quarter. These earnings were well above the high end of our latest EPS guidance range, marking our fifth consecutive quarterly profit. At the start of the recovery, we told you that returning to profitability hinged on running a reliable airline. American continues to run a strong operation in an evolving environment in which we are very well positioned because of the hard work our team has done in recent years. Our sustained profitability is tied to our leading network rewards program and operation. We have a tremendous network and we operate in a reliable and efficient way, and we reward our customers for using it. Now, let's talk more about our financial results. We produced total revenue of $14.1 billion in the second quarter, the highest quarterly revenue in our company's history. This was driven by broad-based demand across all entities with a particular strength in demand for international travel leading into the summer. Throughout the recovery, we have made structural changes to enhance our customers' travel experiences and position the airline for success. We have simplified and harmonized our fleet to create a more nimble and more flexible network that is focused on our most profitable flying. American strength is our network, which is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the demographic changes in the U.S. More people have moved to the Sunbelt region, which is where some of our largest hubs are located. DFW, Charlotte, Miami and Phoenix are very well positioned now and for the future. Our strong regional network provides service to smaller towns and connect them with our hubs across the country, and our global partnerships are a great complement to our own flying. As a result, we are able to offer customers the most comprehensive network of any U.S. carrier. We continue to adapt our offerings to our customers' evolving preferences. We are taking customers to where they want to go and meeting them where they want to do business. We are servicing more of our customers through our direct channels and driving engagement in our advantage program and credit card portfolio. Our Travel Rewards program is the largest among the U.S. network carriers, and it continues to grow. We are making terrific progress in training our pilots and improving the utilization of both our mainline and regional fleet. Our young fleet and low near-term CapEx requirements enable us to generate free cash flow to reinvest in the business and strengthen our balance sheet. Now turning to the operations. The American Airlines team has delivered strong operational results over the past year, and it continued as we achieved record second quarter completion factor. We operated nearly 0.5 million flights in the quarter with an average load factor of approximately 86%. In the second quarter, we also delivered 11 more combined zero canceled days in the same period of a year ago. The summer peak started strong with our team delivering our record Memorial Day weekend mainline completion factor while operating our largest mainline Memorial Day weekend schedule ever. The momentum has continued into July. We delivered the best Independence Day holiday operation in our history, with traffic levels we haven't seen since July of 2019. At American, we're focused on taking care of what we can control. Our purposeful approach to planning, along with our investments in our team, fleet and technology has set us up for success during the busy summer travel season and beyond. And now I'll hand it over to Devon who will share more about our second quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of the year.\nDevon May: Thank you, Robert. The focus and dedication of the American Airlines team has resulted in strong operational performance which is helping to produce solid financial results. Once again, we delivered on our guidance for the second quarter. Excluding net special items, we reported second quarter net income of $1.4 billion or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.92. Our strong operational performance resulted in slightly higher capacity production for the quarter and CASM ex performance better than the midpoint of our forecast. Unit revenues remained strong, resulting in an operating margin and EPS that outperformed the high end of our guidance provided in May. As Robert mentioned, American produced record revenue of $14.1 billion in the second quarter, up nearly 5% year-over-year. This revenue performance led to our highest ever adjusted operating income of $2.2 billion resulting in a second quarter adjusted operating margin of 15.4%. Unit revenue in the quarter was down just 0.5% versus a historically strong 2022 on 5.3% more capacity. Domestic unit revenue was down 1.9%, while international unit revenue was up 18.3% year-over-year. Our unit cost for the quarter, excluding net special items and fuel, was up 3.7% year-over-year. That's better than the midpoint of our initial guidance range due to slightly higher than planned capacity production driven by our strong operational performance. I want to spend a few minutes updating you on our fleet. Our young and simplified fleet differentiates American from our U.S. network peers and provides network flexibility, enhanced efficiency and an improved customer experience. These benefits are the result of the refleeting we pursued from 2014 to 2019 and accelerated during the pandemic. We are pleased we built our fleet in a low interest rate environment and at a time when the supply chain wasn't as challenged as it is today. In 2023, we expect to take delivery of 23 new mainline aircraft which are all now financed. We took 13 deliveries in the first half of the year and expect 10 more aircraft to be delivered by year-end. For our regional fleet, this quarter, we entered into agreements to purchase seven new Embraer 175 aircraft and seven used Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft that will be delivered starting in the fourth quarter of this year. We're excited to have these aircraft into service and to further bolster our regional connectivity. Based on the latest delivery guidance from Boeing and Airbus, along with our new and used regional aircraft purchase commitments, our 2023 aircraft CapEx is now expected to be approximately $1.7 billion. Our non-aircraft CapEx is still expected to be approximately $800 million. We anticipate our 2024 total CapEx to be between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. Looking beyond 2024, we continually review our medium and long-term fleet plans. Due to the young age of our aircraft, our fleet replacement needs are very limited. Therefore, we expect aircraft CapEx for the next several years and likely through the end of the decade to average approximately $3.5 billion per year. Moving to the balance sheet. Yesterday, Fitch upgraded Americans credit rating. This is the first step towards our goal of BB credit metrics by the end of 2025, and it's nice to see our progress being recognized. We continue to maintain strong liquidity. In the second quarter, we generated operating cash flow of nearly $1.8 billion. Our adjusted net investing cash flow was approximately $550 million, resulting in quarterly free cash flow of $1.2 billion. We have produced $4.3 billion of free cash flow in the first six months of the year and expect full year free cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the second quarter with approximately $14.9 billion of total available liquidity. We continue to make progress on strengthening our balance sheet in the second quarter by reducing total debt by $387 million. This debt reduction, combined with the improvement in liquidity resulted in a decrease in net debt of approximately $955 million during the second quarter. We have now reduced total debt by approximately $9.4 billion from peak debt levels in 2021, which is significant progress towards our goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. By the end of 2023, we expect our total debt to be approximately $11 billion lower than peak debt levels in 2021. Importantly, we ended the second quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.8 times, which is lower than it was at the end of 2019. Now turning to our guidance. Bookings remain strong, and we continue to see a constructive demand environment. We saw record revenue for the 4th of July holiday period and booked load factors for the third quarter are in line with what we saw in 2022. International entities continue to lead the way in terms of year-over-year performance, and we are encouraged by domestic business demand, notably from small- and medium-sized enterprises. As the recovery continues to unfold, the strong unit revenue environment in 2022 represents an increasingly difficult comparison. As a result, we expect third quarter TRASM to be down 4.5% to 6.5% year-over-year on 5% to 7% more capacity. We expect third quarter CASM-ex to be up 2% to 4% year-over-year. Our current forecast for the third quarter assumes a fuel price of between $2.55 and $2.65 per gallon. Based on our current demand and fuel price forecast, we expect to produce and adjusted operating margin of between 8% and 10% in the third quarter and adjusted earnings per diluted share of between $0.85 and $0.95, excluding special items. For the full year, we continue to expect to produce capacity that is 5% to 8% higher than 2022. Our full year forecast for unit revenue continues to be up low single digits year-over-year. We now expect our full year CASM-ex to be up 2% to 4% versus 2022. Notably, our expectations for capacity TRASM and CASM-ex are all consistent with the initial guidance we provided on our January earnings call. That said, our estimate for full year fuel expense has changed. We now expect to pay between $2.70 and $2. 80 per gallon, a reduction from our initial guidance. The full year update further highlights the positive environment we are operating in. Based on our demand and fuel cost assumptions, we expect to produce a full year adjusted operating margin of between 8% and 10% and adjusted EPS of between $3 and $3.75. We are very proud of the progress the American Airlines team has made, but we believe there is more opportunity ahead of us. We will continue to focus on delivering in 2023 and unlocking even more value in 2024 and beyond. I'll now turn it back to Robert for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Devon. The American Airlines team is delivering on our commitments. We're on track to deliver on the full year guidance we provided back in January, driving earnings growth, record free cash flow, meaningful debt reduction and importantly, a strong and reliable operation. We are executing on that plan. We are reliable, profitable and making tremendous progress strengthening our balance sheet and I know that our team will continue to deliver. We're excited to share more about our long-term strategy at an Investor Day later this year on our Fort Worth campus. We look forward to updating you on the business and sharing more about our longer-term strategic priorities at that time. We're incredibly excited about the future of American and can't wait to tell you more.  Operator, please open the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Your question please, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Hi, good morning, everybody. All I heard was PMorgan but I assume that's me. So Vasu, you spoke enthusiastically last year about the EMEA. You admitted New York had been a challenge for decades. But you were finally seeing New York RASM outpaced the system. And now it appears that, that all reverses. I'll admit my earnings model doesn't model you by hub. But if it did, why shouldn't I assume New York reverts to being a meaningful margin drag from this point forward?\nVasu Raja: Hi Jamie. Good morning, and thanks for the question. First, I would say that we don't anticipate it being a margin drag. And for full clarity, it's unfortunate the NEA is terminated. Our commitment to the customers in the Northeast and New York specific hasn't changed. However, the circumstances that gave rise to the NEA have changed. At one point in time, we struggled with really two major things. One, our slot holding didn't match with the demand on that is the majority of demand in New York was for short-haul day trip business market. Our slot portfolio is better matched Mid-Continental, Transcontinental and Transatlantic market. Well, that's changed. Short-haul business demand hasn't recovered to its historical level, but those other markets are much greater. And so that's a material change from before. But also our expense base, especially in New York Kennedy has changed. Through co-locating partners and any number of fleet changes, our employment expenses and JFK are materially advantaged to what any other carrier is in New York. So, what that means for us is that is unfortunate that customers don't get the experience of having a much broader network than what was there before. It was a practical matter for American Airlines. We very much expect preserve the continued margin trajectory that we've been on. And as we go forward, we'll certainly share more, but it's very much our plan and our intention that we continue to go see more New York City originating customers flying with us. And so far, since the NEA has been announced, we've seen that. NEA enrollments in the Advantage program continue to rise. Credit card acquisitions continue to rise, spending continues to rise. So though this chapter is closed, another one might open, but we don't expect any material change to our financial outlook.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Very helpful. And then, Devon, on the cost side, recognizing there are lots of moving pieces in the full year CASM guide, can you tell us the last time you adjusted the labor accruals that you're assuming? And also does your full year cash flow guide include retro pay for the pilots?\nDevon May: Yes. So on the cash flow, it does include the retro pay that was part of our or that is part of our tentative agreement that we have with the pilot today. As we talked about last quarter, what we have for an accrual is, we are accruing wages that were agreed to in May as part of the agreement in principle starting on May 1, and we expect the agreement -- or hope the agreement will ratify here in August, at which time, we'll go to the new rates and the benefits associated with that tentative agreement.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Very clear. Thank you, gentlemen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Your line is open, David.\nDavid Vernon: Hi. Good morning, guys. So Robert and Devon, first question for you on the guidance framework you kind of laying out for us here for the back half of the year. It does sort of imply a pretty material deceleration from your earnings level in 2Q to 3Q. And we're hearing from you guys that the demand is good. The team is executing, you're delivering on your cost performance. Can you talk a little bit about the thinking behind how you're laying out the guidance here? You just had a huge beat to your 2Q guide. You haven't missed in a couple of quarters. I'm just trying to understand like are you guys just kind of keeping the bar here where you said it in the beginning of the year, or is there something that's really kind of decelerating here in the back half?\nRobert Isom: David, thanks for the question. Look, we've set out clearly focused on producing profitability and our reliability as our operating reliability is actually really facilitated that. As we take a look at it over the course of the year, you'll see that we actually raised the midpoint of our full year guide by a quarter. It's indicative of our belief that the economy is strong, demand is strong. And for us, look, there's seasonality certainly involved. But at the same time, we're looking at this over the course of the year, and we're going to stay the course, and we feel really positive about the results that we reported and what's coming. And Devon, do you want to add anything to that?\nDevon May: No, I think same points. We started the year and set our objectives for the capacity we're going to produce, the unit costs we're going to produce it at and our earnings levels. We're really happy with what we've accomplished in the first half of the year. The guide we have in place did increase our full year EPS to [$3 to $3.75], and we feel really good about upping that number.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then maybe if you could talk a little bit about sort of the domestic outlook here in the 3Q. You've got, I think, 34% capacity growth in domestic and short-haul international -- how are fair trends kind of moving sequentially. There's a lot of concern, I think, in the market about deceleration in the domestic travel market. Can you kind of elaborate a little bit more on kind of what you're seeing and what you're embedding into the 3Q guide for domestic?\nVasu Raja: Sure thing. This is Vasu. First, look, I'll say at large. We continue to remain encouraged by the overall level of demand we see, especially in domestic and short haul. If you look at air travel spend as a percentage of GDP, certainly retained its relationship revenue, even domestic revenue as a percentage of GDP continue to regain their former relationship to demand.  But for us, it's really important to note is this recovery is continuing to unfold. And as we look out there in domestic, a lot of the sequential change that you see is really due to some pretty unique things. About a point of the 2Q to 3Q changes just due to calendar shift. And another point is due to our operational outperformance in the second quarter. Everything else is really a return to normal seasonality. As far as a deceleration of demand or things like that, we don't yet see it now. And in fact, when you look at it for us, like versus 2019 or some base where you lose just the strange comparisons to how recoveries have unfolded. For us, as we get into the fall, and we will be flying an airline has a date in the 2019 airline but producing short-haul RASMs that are 15% to 20% higher. There's still -- we're still in a world where demand is very strong. The year-over-year comps are a little bit strange, owing more to just the vagaries of the recovery than anything underlying the business.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your question please, Scott?\nScott Group: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Sorry, I lost my voice. But hopefully, you can hear me. I just want to go back to the third quarter guide. So we've just never seen margins go from 15% to 8% to 10%, down 5 to 7 points from Q2 to Q3 -- just any more color to help us think about what's driving that?\nRobert Isom: Hi Scott. Again, I'll tack on to both Vasu's comments and Devon's as well. We're looking at our results over the course of the year. The recovery, as we've seen it has been not exactly smooth on a quarter-to-quarter comparison basis. As we take a look at the year, you can depend on us to produce those results. We're really proud of those. And it's indicated by us, again, moving our EPS guide up as we did this morning.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just to clarify, is there -- are we assuming any earnings impact from losing the NEA, which I know it sounds like you don't think we go back to where we were. But -- is there any earnings impact going forward from losing NEA?\nRobert Isom: Scott, we're not anticipating any earnings impact.\nScott Group: Okay. Great. All right. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Your line is open, Conor.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you for the time. Not a lot of talk on blended travelers or blended itineraries this quarter. Just curious on -- is that just because it's in your base now? And maybe you could just level set us on how you're thinking about large corporate in the back half of 2023. Thank you.\nVasu Raja: Hi. This is Vasu and thanks for the question. And you're exactly right. It's less of a novelty now. This is just part of our base, how the business runs for several quarters now. We've seen a mix of 35% leisure style travel, 35% blended style travel, 30% stuff. And furthermore, within the 30% business, there's roughly a 2:1 split between unmanaged travel and managed travel that's there. That's been pretty consistent for several quarters now. It looks to be pretty consistent going into the future. Certainly, that's what our forward book says. So, that's why no commentary. This is actually how the business operates now.\nConor Cunningham: And just where you're thinking about corporate, sorry?\nVasu Raja: Look, we've seen corporate -- first of all, I'll clarify this. When we talk about business, we talk about people on business style trips. And within that, there's two groups, there's individuals and companies that fly and they don't manage or buy their travel centrally, and then there's large corporations that tend to man it by their travel centrally. We've seen that those customers who were managed, they buy their travel centrally has -- it's recovered to 80% of historical levels. And that's been pretty much plateaued for several quarters now. However, unmanaged demand continues to grow in our system. And indeed, total business revenues have really regained their 2019 composition in the system. So we remain encouraged on business demand. Should things change, we're prepared to go and adjust accordingly. But no forward change to outlook is any different than the stuff we've been experiencing.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then just on the competitive environment in the domestic market, the ULCCs and LCCs have been ramp in capacity in the back half and a lot of that's hit in your hubs. I'm just curious on how you view the competitive landscape right now as you think about the back half of 2023. Thank you.\nVasu Raja: Hi, thank you. And look, we actually view the competitive landscape very favorably. Our network proposition to our customers is creating more origin and destination markets and more unique origin and destination markets than any other airline network. And we have done that really well. We continue to do that really well. That's really been the financial progress that that we've seen. And to Robert's comments with roughly 70% of the airline network is located in the Sunbelt in our Latin America network and London Heathrow are in places where we really deliver a lot of outsized value for customers. And there, while we do see competitors come in, we remain encouraged. Take any number of those markets in our short-haul Latin American markets. We've seen something like 20%, 25% industry capacity growth, but the trends are favorable enough where this fall and winter will fly our largest schedule there, not because we're out to chase market share, but because of the marginal performance of those rates.\nConor Cunningham: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of TD Cowen. Your question please, Helane.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much. So, hi, team. Thanks for the time. Robert, I thought I heard you say on CNBC this morning that you're meeting with your pilots to talk about matching the United contract. Did I hear that correctly, A? And B, do you have to let them vote and reject the contract that they're voting on now? Or can you adjust it and they vote on any changes you might want to make?\nRobert Isom: Hi Helane, thanks for the question. Look, in terms of how we actually are able to deliver to our products, that's going to be something that we have to work on with them, and we're in discussions with APA -- right now, as a matter of fact. What I said this morning is something I'm really proud of and that we're committed to. Look, we're going to match the wages that United is proposing. We've got to sit down with to figure out whether or not that is something that they can fit into their the TA that can still be voted on a timely basis or if it's something that's going to take more time to figure out. But we're committed to matching those wages.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then just shifting gears for a minute. You guys have been delivering a really great operation for the past, I don't know, at least three quarters, right, as somebody who's shifted from New York to Philadelphia. I can see it in my flying. And I'm just kind of wondering, are you seeing that also in your Net Promoter Scores? Can you talk about what customers are seeing? And are you seeing any share shift from any of your competitors to yourselves?\nRobert Isom: Well, Helane, thanks for bringing it up. We're really proud of the work that we've done over the last year. It's just a tremendous and relentless focus. It's led by David Seymour, our Chief Operating Officer. And every day, our team is out there, including today, in this ridiculous heat and weather, they're just performing. We've done everything from training to adding new knowledge. And when things go awry, we have been really quick to make sure that we have the tools necessary to put things back in place, whether that be aircraft or our crews. And that's going to continue. I anticipate that we're going to get better and better. Of course, that translates into likelihood to recommend scores and Net Promoter Scores that are the best that we have ever seen. And I have great confidence that, that is something that will continue to play out. That relationship between reliability and what customers really want is super evident.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your question please. Brandon.\nBrandon Oglenski: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Vasu, I want to come back to the unwind of the NEA because it does look like you have quite a bit of international capacity you've added at JFK, but not a lot of domestic connectivity on your own network. And I think JetBlue was part of that answer historically. So, can you talk to what the long-haul strategy looks like out of JFK going forward?\nVasu Raja: Yes. Thanks for the question, Brandon. Look, there were really two issues that we had in New York. One was the amount of connectivity support that we had for our long-haul and the other was just the huge expenses we had operating out of New York Kennedy. As I mentioned earlier, we've done a lot of things to go and reduce our expense base to where, it's not just more in line with our other low-cost hubs that's materially lower than what any other operator has in New York City. But also -- and this is meaningful to it. Look, the NEA was a great outcome for customers who got to go and experience our product who weren't there before. But actually, when you look at those international flights, roughly, as things have settled out and markets recover, roughly 35 to 40 points of the load factor that's on them is actually being generated by our international partners. Our partnership within the NEA was actually a very small amount of the onboard load factor that's there. That's why when we couple both the expense reduction that's there and some changes that we can make ourselves, we believe that we can go and really replace a lot of the demand, especially now that we've got such a larger New York City originating customer base than what we had before.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate that response. And I guess maybe a quick one for Devon, because I think you mentioned aircraft purchases out in the future could be around $3 billion to $3.5 billion annually, if I heard it correctly. Do you think strategically, that's the right level of reinvestment in the business, especially given that some of your competitors might be spending a bit more than that?\nDevon May: Hi Brandon. Yes, so the comment was we think we'll have somewhere around $3.5 billion on average of aircraft capital beyond 2024 and probably for a good part of the decade. And where we are different than our competitors is we don't have any fleet replacement needs between now and the end of the decade. So when we are investing in an aircraft that is an investment to grow the network and to grow the airline. What you're seeing from some of our other competitors who just have older airplanes, there's a lot of fleet replacement CapEx required for them. And again, for us, it is just growth aircraft requirements.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your question please, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hi, good morning. I'm really tempted to ask another NEA wind-down question, but we'll leave that for off-line. Maybe just on fleet. Where do you think your biggest gap or constraint is at the moment? Like where do you wish you could be bigger today? And can you talk a little bit about -- I think you mentioned some regional fleet adds. What are the kind of staffing circumstances you see that are allowing you to invest there?\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Duane. Just a couple of things. Look, I think as you take a look at the industry and especially our needs at American, we're going to need larger narrow-bodies in a number of places. It just fits with how our hub structure works and all the kind of things that Vasu wants to do. I would add to that, though, that probably our biggest and most interesting opportunity right away. It's getting our regional fleet fully back up in the air. And the those aircraft only further our commercial proposition by adding more small markets to what is a great hub and spoke system already. So as we take a look out into the future, you'll see us make sure that we protect ourselves and that we are able to not only replace an upgauge from a narrow body perspective but also have an eye to be able to grow at a rate appropriate for demand levels.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then just for my follow-up, could you just remind us maybe some of the differences in your transatlantic geography versus peers? And maybe it's too fine of a point, but could you contrast kind of your Southern Europe exposure relative to Delta and United? Thanks for taking the questions. \nRobert Isom: Thanks for asking them. Look, and for us, so much of our trans-Atlantic and I'll just speak to the European content at this point, not other things that sometimes get lumped into reporting such as Middle East or India. But for us, a lot of our concentration is, first and foremost, in London, probably much more so than what other airlines are. And that which is in Southern Europe is really heavily season style flying or as we call it large areas the large capital market things like Rome and Athens, Barcelona and Madrid. So we've done a lot over the last several years to actually further to Devon's earlier point, to really restructure our international network. We used to fly a lot of really marginal flights to really marginal markets, and they work for three months of the year and we had nothing to do with the airplane for the other nine months of the year. So we've used the last three years to go and rebuild the foundation, bottom 5% of our capacity is gone fleet that goes with it is gone and the losses that we took from it are gone. And so now what we're building back to Devon's point, of just moderate growth is adding things that really make sense and are a good use of full year aircraft capital.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Your question please, Andrew.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. First question, Devon, I just wanted to make sure I was clear in terms of what is in your CASM outlook for this year. Does it just include the step-up in pay rates beginning May 1 from the TA? Or do you also factor in a step-up in profit share and work rules? Just want to be clear on what's included there.\nDevon May: Yes. So right now, what's included in our guide is Pay rates from May 1 through the end of July. And then starting in August, we hope to have ratification of the tentative agreement. And at that point, we'll have pay rates and all the benefits that go along with it, including the higher profit sharing.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And then Robert, I know it's early on, but just when you think about 2024, any initial thoughts on how you're thinking about capacity and the way you kind of -- the continued build-out of both your domestic and international networks. Just curious which entity you think could -- between domestic and international could be growing the most next year and just how you think about growth. Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Andrew. Right now, it's -- we're in the planning stages. But what I'd tell you is that based on the kind of fleet that we have, we would have anticipated mid-single-digit growth for next year. Now, there's a lot of dependencies on that. So first off, we have to be able to get our regional fleet back up fully, and that requires pilots. We've -- to be able to achieve that kind of level of flying we would have to also get a little bit more out of the aircraft we have in terms of utilization as a whole. And the final thing is we're dependent on the airframe manufacturers to actually deliver. They're getting better. Their track record hasn't been great. So we'll see how that shakes out. And if it all comes to fruition, that's probably a pretty good guess at this point.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, Michael.\nMichael Linenberg: Hi, good morning, everyone and congrats on the 2-notch upgrade from Fitch. I guess two questions here. I guess, Vasu, just with the rollout of your new distribution strategy, any early learnings direct versus indirect. I sort of caught the two to one, unmanaged versus managed on your corporate piece. I think if we go back historically, they were probably more evenly divided. So it seems like there's a bit of a shift there. Whatever you can tell us. Thanks, and then I have a follow-up.\nVasu Raja: Hi. Thanks Mike. It's an excellent question. I was wondering when it might be asked. Look, first of all, all of our selling and distribution changes are done with a really simple lens, really which Robert talked about in his opening remarks. We want to make it as easy as possible for our best customers to be able to shop by and self-service their experience with American Airlines. And everything has been oriented around that. It has indeed been very eye-opening and has performed probably above what our expectations are. The simplest way to it is like this. If you take all of our customers, the actual human, you can divide them into two groups, those who are not members of the AAdvantage program and those who are members of the AAdvantage program. In the quarter, for those customers who are not numbers of the AAdvantage program, indeed, their total travel bell 5%, but revenue from that cohort grew by 5%. Amongst the customers who are advantaged customers, we actually grew their transactions by 8% and their revenues by 13%. That is certainly above what we had expected, but also what we're really encouraged by our three things: first, for every -- there's a high level of attachment for all of our Advantage customers. For every dollar of flight revenue they bring in, they bring in about $0.10 of other revenue primarily on a branded credit card. Two, the cost of sale is materially lower amongst our advantage customers. It's not just that we're paying less in booking fees and commissions and things like that. But what we've found is something like 25% to 30% of our calls to reservations are actually bookings at a travel agency originated and is, for some reason, unable to go in service. So there's a lot of implicit savings that we see from it. And last and maybe most importantly, we're encouraged by what we see is really the durability of these customers' demand. These are customers who tend to use our network where it's most unique. They fly more times in a year. They already have bookings out into the fall. They tend to sell themselves up. And importantly, they prefer coming to us direct. So we're currently in taking roughly 70% to 75% of our revenues going through our direct channels. We anticipate that will grow. We're encouraged by this, and we're actually going to continue to accelerate the changes. By the end of the year, 100% of what we sell, customers will be able to service online through our app or our dot-com. We'll roll out those features also over time for new distribution technology. But as this happens, we'll make increasingly less and less of our fare content available through traditional technology where customers aren't able to get that quality experience that they're looking for from us.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Awesome response. And then just my second question, I guess, is to you as well, when I sort of look at it in the forward schedules, it does look like even up to summer of next year, that JetBlue is still maintaining a significant presence in LaGuardia. And so presumably, you will still continue to lease those slots to them and maybe maintain a smaller presence in LaGuardia than what you had pre-NEA? Or is that just -- are those placeholder schedules and that's TBD. Thanks for answering my question. \nRobert Isom: Yes, Mike. A lot of that is TBD right now. And in fact, Priya Aiyar is here our General Counsel. We're still in a process of determining how to wind down the NEA most notably how we transfer back all of the slots to American Airlines as soon as we can.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now move to media questions and answers. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal. Your question, please Alison.\nAlison Sider: Hi. Thanks so much. Do you have a sense yet of how much more costly the pilot deal could be if you have to go back and boost the pay rates and other adjustments to match the United deal?\nRobert Isom: I'm looking at Devon. We're working on that right now. Look, one of the things I do know is that in our TA, there was significant quality of life and compensation improvements. The vast majority are very close to what United has supposedly in their TA. And while there may be some adjustments that would be required for wages, it's not an indoor amount. Devon, do you have any idea on that?\nDevon May: Yes. We're working through the numbers right now. Obviously, the wages are close, but a couple of percent higher than what we have in our tenant agreement. And we're trying to get more detail on other items that we think might be material. But what we have with our attentive agreement is really significant improvements for our pilots. And as Robert mentioned earlier, the wages is some we're focused on right now to see if we can work with the APA to get some done where we match what United or for.\nAlison Sider: Great. Thanks. And I guess, Robert, you talked a little bit about this earlier this morning, but just curious if there's any kind of impact you're seeing from this crazy heat we're seeing in parts of the country, if that requires any operational changes or different ways of thinking about things for crew and for customers and how you're dealing with that?\nRobert Isom: So, hi Ali, and I have David Seymour here to help me. Look, the heat that we're facing this year in the country, I mean, these are records, and it is something that impacts certainly, the aircraft, any machinery, they're more like they're great and run harder and longer. And it's also really hard on our people. Fortunately, we have great experience in dealing with hot weather hubs, places like Phoenix in Miami and even DFW and Charlotte as well. So we're employing all those practices that we put in place. We're just having to use them more often and longer throughout the year. I'll give just a couple of examples of things that we've done on a precautionary basis just because of the trends that we've seen. We put a heck of lot more work into making sure that we're prepared for the summer on things like conditioned air at our jet bridges. So as soon as an aircraft pulls up to a gate, we want to make sure that we can get air to those aircraft to keep them as cool as possible. Our APUs, those little engines that are able to power all the systems when the big engines are off. Those are things that are prone to break during times like right now, but we're seeing really good results because of the preventative work that our maintenance team has done. And you'll see us as well, whether it's making sure that we only board when aircraft are have air conditioning that is appropriate or out on the ramp with our team members, making sure that they get a break from the sun and the heat that there are things like ice carts and electrolyte drinks available to our team members, we're really taking this seriously, and we're going to have to as we go forward.\nAlison Sider: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg News. Your question please, Mary?\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi. Good morning. I had just two quick questions. Vasu, on the LaGuardia slots, are you prohibited from leasing those slots to JetBlue for just their own use for their own flight? So do you have to take those slots back? You can't lease them to them under any circumstances. And my second question is on the pilot talks, are you reopening the whole contract to discussion? Or are you limiting it to changes in pay?\nVasu Raja: So I'll handle the -- I can handle both. First off, in regard to anything that relates to slots or gates or routes or things like that. Look, we're going to figure that out over time. So I'll leave it at that. And then in regard to our pilots, as I mentioned, we're sitting down with our pilots. We have a real interest in making sure that they're taking care of. That's been how we viewed all discussions. And so, we'll see how that goes. My hope is that we can get something done pretty quickly. And no matter what, over the long run, we're going to make sure that our pilots are taking care of.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Please go ahead, Leslie. \nLeslie Josephs: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the pilot contract. I just want to make sure that I understand correctly, you are committing to matching the United rates. I just want to make sure we're clear on that. And then just a second question on buy-ups to premium cabins. We didn't hear a ton of that from you guys. And just kind of curious what you're seeing, especially for premium leisure and international -- are you seeing higher paid loads in premium economy and then in business class. Thank you\nRobert Isom: I'll handle the first one, Leslie, and Vasu can handle the second one. Just, look, again, in regard to your question, we're working with the APA and our pilots -- our intent is to match the wages that we're aware of in the tentative agreement that United has signed.\nVasu Raja: Yes. And Leslie, we do -- we've noted it all through the recovery, but we've continued to see strength in premium cabin style fares. Our total premium seats across the system are up about 5% year-over-year. Our total premium revenues were up about 15% year-over-year. And notably, it's pretty consistent across all of our markets in London, for example. We've grown our premium seats about 20% or so. Our premium revenues are up over 25%. And that's at a time when so much of the industry is adding back into London. But we are encouraged, and we're uniquely encouraged by the trajectory that we're on different from others. For the first time in our history, our unit revenue performance in Trans-Atlantic will outperform any of our joint venture partners, both for the quarter and for the full year. So we do see that strength. It's complemented by our distribution strategies, and we see more opportunity ahead.\nLeslie Josephs: And just one quick follow-up. When you get out of the summer season, are you seeing any kind of falloff in either fares or bookings with the TRASM coming down and then the inflation report showing that airfares are coming down in the U.S.\nVasu Raja: Nothing beyond historical seasonality, Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Koenig of The Associated Press. Your question, please David?\nDavid Koenig: Okay. Thanks. I didn't hear my name. I guess it's me. Robert, you've talked about matching the United deal, which APA had valued their previous TA at 8.3 billion, and this is going to add a couple of percentage points. Do you plan or do you need to raise fares to cover the contracts with the APA, the APA or other contracts and still remain profitable, should people expect higher fares?\nRobert Isom: David, thanks for the question. Look, over time, we're going to run a profitable business. So we have to offer a really compelling product offering to our customers. We're going to try to find ways to make sure that we can do that in a way that customers will benefit and ultimately, it will take more revenue to pay for higher cost going to do everything that we can to be as efficient as possible take care of our team members, but also offer a very compelling and worthwhile product to our customers.\nDavid Koenig: Okay Any other areas for revenue besides fares?\nRobert Isom: None beyond what we've already spoken about in the call.\nDavid Koenig: Sure. Thanks.\nRobert Isom: We're really proud of our incredible network that we're flying reliably, and we've got an industry-leading rewards program. We're going to tap into those and make sure that customers are really able to benefit from everything that we can do on that front. \nDavid Koenig: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of this call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?\nRobert Isom: Hey Atif, thanks so much. And I'll just close out this way. Look, you can continue to hold us accountable for relentless focus on reliability, profitability and strengthening our balance sheet. And I'll just point to the second quarter results. In terms of reliability, no one has been better than American Airlines over the last year. In terms of profitability, this second quarter beat of all analyst expectations is just proof that our commercial offerings are really registering with our customers. You run reliably, you produce profits, you can strengthen your balance sheet. This 2-notch upgrade from Fitch today is, again, indicative that we're doing the right things, and we would anticipate further strengthening on that front. All of it together, this outstanding second quarter for us is proof positive that our efforts are working. We're going to get back at it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Thank you for your interest and joining us this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone. American is off to a fantastic start in 2023. This year, we remain focused on reliability, profitability, strengthening our balance sheet and holding ourselves accountable along the way.  This morning, American reported a first quarter profit for the first time in four years, an improvement of almost $2 billion versus the first quarter of 2022. Our performance in the first quarter was driven by continued strength and demand and the tremendous work of our team.  American entered the year in a position of strength after the outstanding results our team delivered in 2022 and we built on that momentum in the first quarter. The American Airlines team ran a reliable operation for our customers and delivered profit for the quarter, beating our initial EPS guidance of approximately breakeven.  Let's talk more about our first quarter results. We produced record first quarter revenues of nearly $12.2 billion, an increase of 37% versus 2022 on 9.2% more capacity year-over-year.  Demand for our product remains strong. We continue to be very pleased with our domestic and short haul international unit revenue performance. We've also seen noticeable strength in long haul international demand, though we have allocated approximately 80% of our second quarter capacity growth year-over-year and continue to see strong yield performance carrying into the summer months. Demand for our premium cabin has been remarkable across all entities, with premium paid load factor and RASM exceeding 2019 levels.  We're well on our way to a fully recovered business but we aren't there yet. The recovery is still unfolding and the current demand environment remains dynamic. We continue to learn about evolving customer preferences and changing demand patterns, and we spent the past three years building a resilient airline that can adjust to the variability in demand. We remain nimble and continue to adapt to customer behaviors, both in terms of when and where customers book travel and how we service them.  Importantly, customers continue to show preference for our direct channels and travel rewards program. Our co-brand growth continues to outperform consumer spending, in line with AAdvantage enrollment, which are now approximately 60% higher than 2019 on capacity that has not yet fully restored to 2019 levels.  The American Airlines co-brand portfolio is delivering the fastest growth since the inception of our current agreements with double-digit growth in sales versus the first quarter of 2022.  Now let's turn to the operation. The American Airlines team delivered a stellar performance in the first quarter. We operated more than 476,000 flights in the quarter with an average load factor of 80%. We delivered our best ever first quarter completion factor and controllable completion factor, safely completing more flights and more on-time flights than anyone in the industry. We're performing better than ever from an operational perspective.  We delivered this strong performance in the first quarter despite the nationwide ground stop in mid-January due to the NOTAM outage and several disruptive weather events that impacted our hubs across the country. Our largest hub, DFW, was greatly impacted by winter storms in January and February, and tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in March.  Our strong operational performance is driven by our team's focus on running a safe and reliable airline and taking care of what we can control. Investments in our operation have enabled us to anticipate the operating conditions ahead of us and recover quickly when the unexpected happens. And we'll continue to invest in our team, fleet and technology, so that we're well prepared heading into the summer and the rest of the year.  I also want to thank and acknowledge the DoT and the FAA for their efforts to reduce congestion in New York, which will certainly help the industry deliver more reliably for customers this summer.  And now over to Devon to share more about our first quarter results and the outlook for the second quarter. \nDevon May : Thank you, Robert. I'm tremendously proud of what the American Airlines team accomplished during the first quarter. As Robert mentioned, we ran a great operation and delivered on our financial guidance for the quarter, keeping us on track with the full year plan we outlined in January.  During the first quarter, excluding net special items, we reported net income of $33 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.05. This result is better than the initial guidance we provided in January, driven by strong revenue production and slightly lower fuel expense during the quarter.  As Robert mentioned, we produced record first quarter revenue of $12.2 billion, up 37% year-over-year. Unit revenue was 25.4% higher in the quarter on 9.2% more capacity. Unit costs for the quarter excluding net special items and fuel were 1.4% lower year-over-year, in line with the midpoint of our initial guidance range. We generated adjusted operating income in the quarter of $451 million, resulting in a first quarter adjusted operating margin of 3.7%.  We have made significant investments in our fleet over the past decade and these investments are paying off. The re-fleeting of the airlines and the reconfiguration of our narrowbody interiors have greatly improved the customer experience, simplified our mainline fleet from eight aircraft size to four, and aligned our narrowbody density with our network competitors. American continues to operate the simplest and youngest fleet among US network carriers.  We continue to expect to reactivate nine 737s from long-term storage and take delivery of 23 new aircraft in 2023. We took three deliveries in the first quarter and expect nine in the second quarter, five in the third quarter and six in the fourth quarter. 13 of the deliveries are already financed and we expect to finalize financing agreement for the remaining 10 this quarter. Based on the latest delivery guidance from Boeing and Airbus, our 2023 aircraft CapEx is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion and non-aircraft CapEx is expected to be approximately $800 million.  In the first quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $3.3 billion. Our adjusted net investing cash flows were $317 million, resulting in record quarterly free cash flow generation of $3 billion. We ended the quarter with $14.4 billion of total available liquidity, $2.4 billion more than our year-end 2022 liquidity balance, driven by booking strength and ATL growth in the quarter.  We continue to make progress on strengthening our balance sheet, reducing total debt by more than $850 million in the quarter. This debt reduction, combined with the improvement in liquidity, resulted in a $3.4 billion decrease in net debt during the first quarter. We now have reduced total debt by more than $9 billion from peak debt levels in mid-2021.  Importantly, we ended the first quarter with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.5 times, which is lower than our net debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of 2019. By the end of 2023, we continue to expect our total debt to be $10 billion to $11 billion lower than peak debt levels in mid-2021, and we remain committed to our goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025.  Additionally, a constructive financing environment in February allowed us to proactively refinance the 2025 maturity, our $1.75 billion term loan primarily collateralized by our South American portfolio of slots, gates and routes. The refinancing transaction efficiently derisked our 2025 debt maturity tower by nearly 20%. We will continue to balance debt reduction opportunities and investments in the business, while meeting appropriate liquidity levels.  We continue to see a constructive demand environment in the second quarter and summer and bookings remain strong. Revenue intakes in the past month are well ahead of the same booking period in 2019, including robust international bookings as customers returned to long haul international travel this summer.  Compared to the historically strong unit revenue we produced in 2022, we expect second quarter TRASM to be down 2% to 4% year-over-year on 3.5% to 5% more capacity. We expect second quarter CASMx to be up 3.5% to 5.5% year-over-year. This projection includes the impact of an anticipated pilots agreement. We continue to expect the full year impact of all anticipated labor agreements to be approximately 3 points of CASMx.  Our current forecast for the second quarter assumes a fuel price of between $2.65 and $2.75 per gallon, which is $1.30 per gallon lower year-over-year. We expect to produce an operating margin of between 11% and 13% in the second quarter based on our current demand and fuel price forecast. Excluding special items, we expect to produce earnings of between $1.20 and $1.40 per diluted share in the second quarter. These strong results keep us on track to execute on our full year earnings guidance of between $2.50 and $3.50 per diluted share.  Now, I'd like to hand it back to Robert for further remarks. \nRobert Isom : Thanks, Devon. And to close, I'd like to take just a few minutes to highlight why I'm so excited about the future of the industry and the future of American Airlines, in particular.  Our industry has been through the biggest crisis in its history and is now on the other side. Airlines have navigated a lot over the last few years. Concerns about the economy and demand recovery, the banking crisis, the interest rate environment, supply chain issues, and yet here we are.  The industry is in an excellent position and benefiting not only from the recovery involving travel patterns, but also from consumers' changing preference of experiences, over hard goods. And I'd like to underscore, we see a strong demand environment this summer, and we're highly confident that that will continue going forward. If there's one thing that the pandemic has taught us, it's that people innately desire to travel.  And at American, the actions that we've taken in recent years are producing returns. We've simplified and harmonized our fleet to provide more flexibility to our network, which is nimbler and more focused on our most profitable flying. And our Sunbelt hubs are uniquely positioned to take advantage of demographic changes going on in the US right now. We've got partnerships that are a great complement to our network, enable us to provide even more unique O&Ds to our customers.  Our fleet, which is younger than our network peers, has [ph] low CapEx requirements in the near term, enabling us to generate free cash flow that can be used to reinvest in the business and strengthen our balance sheet. We've also made investments to modernize our facilities and introduce new technology throughout the airline. These initiatives are producing the results that we had hoped for.  And we have a number of opportunities in front of us to deliver even more value. We're making terrific progress training pilots, getting our regional fleet back up in the air and getting more out of our mainline fleet as well. That means that there is real and significant upside in terms of the utilization of our existing assets.  We're also very encouraged by our operational focus, and our ability to grow the airline efficiently, all while completing more flights on schedule, generating more revenue and reducing costs.  On the commercial side, we're building on our premier loyalty program, and the changes we have made are having a real impact on how customers are spending and engaging with us. There's even more we'll do in the coming years to grow AAdvantage and our co-brand offerings.  We're meeting our customers where they want to do business and bringing more people into our direction channel. We'll continue to adapt our offerings based on evolving customer preferences.  Finally, we are driving a technology first mindset at American, not only with existing processes, but also with the introduction of new tools for our customers and team. We look forward to sharing more on all of this as the year progresses.  Looking ahead, we feel great about the industry and what's to come for American. The actions that we have taken have put us in a position of strength that have allowed us to capitalize on the recovery. We'll continue to hold ourselves accountable to produce stronger margins, generate free cash flow, strengthen our balance sheet and run a reliable operation, ultimately creating more value for our customers and shareholders.  And with that, operator, please open the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Robert, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about inter quarter trends and how second quarter sort of is shaping up from a booking perspective. I think investors have been very sensitive to potential sort of disruptions or changes in maybe business travel trends kind of as we've gone through the banking crisis here. I'm wondering if you could just kind of give us a sense for what you're seeing day to day in the booking curve and how that is impacting your confidence and the outlook for summer travel.\nRobert Isom: I'm going to send that straight to Vasu. \nVasu Raja: Look, we remain encouraged by the demand environment that's out there. We see strong booking strength really across the airline network. International, of course, long haul international is seeing a lot more bookings come in a lot sooner, really reflecting the pent up demand that's been there in many markets. And they really haven't been open for the better part of four years. Domestically, we continue to see historically strong booking and indeed a resumption of a lot of \u2013 a lot more people booking further in advance than what they did last year. Certainly, more people willing to go and shift from a peak time flight to a trough time flight, which reflects changes in work schedules through the week. But by and large, we remain encouraged by what we see out there.  And I'll add to that too that, consistent with a lot of the trends that we've seen in past quarters, we continue to see a shift from a traditional business style trip to more blended trips and more discretionary trips. In Q1, about 30%, 35% of our volume was leisure, discretionary based trips, 35% blended trips, and 30% business trips. That compares to first quarter 2019 where it was more like 30% leisure, 30% blended, 40% business. But we remain encouraged by it. Though we're seeing that shift, we find that very often, the blended yields that we see are coming in at values that are 8% to 10% higher than the very traditional business trips that they replace. So we remain encouraged and see a lot of the same trends we've been talking about for the last few quarters.\nDavid Vernon: Devon, could I could I ask you to talk a little bit about the maturities coming up in the next couple of years on the debt stack? You mentioned you're going to be paying down around $2 billion of debt this year. How should we be looking from a liquidity perspective at the end of 2023 based on the guidance? And how does that compare to the maturities in kind of a two to three year timeframe?\nDevon May: To start this year, we talked about our total debt paid down being at approximately $10 billion to $11 billion from our peak levels of summer of 2021. For this year, we expect total debt to be down about $3 billion versus 2022.  In terms of where our cash will be at the end of the year, obviously, we've talked a lot about a $10 billion to $12 billion target for liquidity. We're well ahead of that at the end of the first quarter. When we think $10 billion to $12 billion, I generally think of it as we'd like to be around $10 billion of liquidity as we are late in the year [indiscernible] for liquidity. That arrives to $12 billion during the year.  At this point, we're well ahead of our target liquidity and expect we would definitely be on the high end of target liquidity if we hit the midpoint of our guidance this year. And then, just longer term, 2024, we have a little bit of a step up in maturities. I think most people understand in 2025, we have a higher debt tower. We proactively addressed some of that with a refinancing in the first quarter. The remainder of it, we will seek to either pay down or refinance a portion of it depending on our cash flow production over the next couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Just two questions. One, I'm wondering, on operations, Robert, you mentioned in the quarter that you were, I think, at the top of on-time performance in and so on. I'm wondering if you could talk about some of the learnings that you've had in being with, like, the Dallas storms and the NOTAM shutdown and then what happened in Fort Lauderdale earlier this month, just how that will carry through to prepare yourselves for the summer, which is likely to be pretty difficult.  And then, my second question is, I'm wondering if, Vasu, you can talk about the changes you made to NDC and travel agent bookings and how that's being received.\nRobert Isom: We've learned a lot over the last year. Let's face it. Summer 2022 was pretty rocky. And during that time, we got right to work to make sure that we plan the airlines for the resources that we have. And that's played out over the course of this past year. We got stronger and stronger as the 2022 closed.  And as we progress through 2023, what I'm most encouraged about is really when conditions permit, we fly an exceptional airlines. We complete nearly every flight. And that bodes well for the summer. I know that there are going to be issues. And you're going to have to stay on top of things. But we've never been more prepared from the perspective of having the right resources in the right place. And that's everything from gates at the station level to pilot, flight attendants, to mechanics. So, we feel really good about where we're heading.  But your question about, hey, issues happen. So we're planned well. But in terms of those issues and disruptions, they're going to happen. We had severe thunderstorms here in DFW last night. But we have new tools in place that allow us to build back from any disruption in a lot better fashion, and one that, quite frankly, protects more passengers. So our misconnection rates are very, very manageable right now. And as we take a look going forward, the tools that we've put in place, a system called HEAT that is appropriately named as heat builds up and thunderstorms happen and disruptions happen, what we do is we actually put in place delay programs and cancellation programs that protect the system and protect the most number of customers, and ultimately allow us to recover quicker.  Now, this is part of a bigger, longer range plan. And I'm probably going to give more of an answer here than you need. But after the last five years of integration, then the pandemic, we're at a point where we can really do a lot more with the assets that we have. We have a new CIO here, Ganesh Jayaram, and I want him to just talk quickly about that technology first mindset that we've introduced that is really going to get at the heart of those questions that you're bringing up about operational reliability. Ganesh?\nGanesh Jayaram: The past seven months that I've been in this role, our technology team has refined our playbook to work better and faster with our partners in the priority areas of operations and commercial for deliver technology solutions that meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and team members.  So going forward, we're really excited that we bring new digital solutions to the market in a much more agile manner than in the past, improve our customers' ability to self-serve all the needs of the American as well as solutions like HEAT that improve the resilience of our daily flight operations.  Lastly, the technology team, we're working very closely with Devon and the finance team to invest appropriately in modernizing our technology stack to help us deliver the additional capabilities of the future.  I can now turn it over to Vasu and David to share some examples of solutions that we're excited to bring to the market in the rest of the year.\nVasu Raja: I can pick up a little bit on the technology points. But let me speak very directly to your question about distribution. It's really important to understand our changes through the lens of how our customers have changed because that is our true north. Understanding that and building our enterprise around that is how we create value.  So, earlier, I mentioned how the transaction mix has changed and has been changing. But what's really important is the beyond that transaction mix, how our customers consume our product has changed materially. So if you go back to 2019 and look at all the unique customers who took a business trip, the top 60% of business traveling customers produced well over 80% of all the business travel revenue at American Airlines. When you look at that in 2023, that same population of unique customers is actually spending 15% more on flight revenue with the airline. However, the mix of their trips has changed materially. It used to be that over 50% of their trips were purely for business purposes. Now well less than 40% of their trips are for purely business purposes. That, let's call it, 10 to 15 points of shift has gone pretty much entirely to blended style trips. But it's gone entirely out of the travel agency distribution channel and into our direct channels, like dot com and app.  So, that's been a thing we've been observing really for the better part of the last year, and the trends continue to accelerate. And you see now across our commercial changes. We've actively repositioned the network where we fly less in short haul markets, like, say, New York to Chicago or we start in new markets like New York to Tulsa.  We've done things with our loyalty program, our AAdvantage travel rewards program to make it easier to go and earn miles for things which aren't just taking a historical business trip where fewer of those travelers are doing it.  But the next and very important part is how we sell and service our product. And what we've realized is so many of those customers are going direct, frankly, because they're used to a consumer experience at any other retailer where they can buy the product and shop digitally, and they can service it themselves.  So when you look at it through that lens, our changes are really kind of the simple. By the end of Q2, anything that we sell in a US point of origination, a customer will be able to go and service \u2013 buy and service digitally through our dot com and our app, which is a huge change from where the airline's been, a marked difference from where many of our competitors are.  However, traditional travel agency technology doesn't enable us to roll those same services out through it. But some of the new travel agency technology that's there that people like Sabre and Amadeus and Travelport are offering enable us to do exactly that.  So as the summer rolls on, you'll see us rolling more of our selling and servicing tools into this new distribution capability. And that's something which, ultimately, should be beneficial to travel agencies. That'll enable really forward thinking agencies to serve our joint customers a whole lot better. And so far, we've been actually extremely encouraged. We've had three or four weeks now where we've been migrating more services and more of our fare products on this new distribution technology. And the results have been extremely encouraging.  So if you look at first quarter, about 10% of our revenue was booked by travel agencies. We're now \u2013 virtually all of their future bookings are coming through new distribution technologies. We've also seen new travel agency competitors emerge, and they're growing at an exponential week to week rate. And they're really disrupting the traditional travel management company model. At their current rate of bookings, they will be as large as any of the three largest travel management companies in terms of booked AA revenue probably by this summer.  And what we're really encouraged by is, every day, a new corporate customer is coming to us asking about how they can connect directly to us or how they go and best source all the fare content of American Airlines.  So the important thing is really, for us, we are making our changes really in service where our customers are going. We think it's something which can be great for the travel agency community. But above all, the end consumer is going to benefit from more competition, better services, lower cost of sale. So we're encouraged where this is going.\nRobert Isom: Appreciate you letting us go long on that. Because you can tell, your question gets to the heart of everything that we're doing from a strategic perspective, operationally and commercially.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I have a network question, maybe a little bit of a philosophical one for Vasu or Robert. As we think back to historical periods for the airline industry, there were definitely periods where international growth was funded by domestic capacity cuts, when international growth prospects were more attractive. And if we think about the experience through the pandemic where everyone was domestically focused and Florida focused because that was the only thing open. Now slowly market by market, the rest of the world has gradually become Florida too. You all now have a much larger opportunity set. So why don't you think we're seeing some \u2013 the domestic bets which were totally appropriate in the pandemic context being rolled back? And what do you think the set of circumstances that would drive a better portfolio outcome by funding international growth with domestic cuts, and appreciate the long winded philosophical question?\nRobert Isom: I'll start with, I think, some realities in the business and then Vasu can do more from the philosophical standpoint. But first I just think it's important for people to know that American is growing less than anybody else this this year, and it's not necessarily by choice. Let's face it. We've run into issues with the constraints that we're all aware of. Manufacturers haven't been able to deliver aircraft on time. And we've had pilot constraints that have gotten in the way. And that has to some degree shaped what we've been able to do. So we have, I think, almost 150 regional aircraft that are still in the ground, and we're not serving a lot of cities, small cities that really have lost service. And we'd like to get back into. And so, I think that that's an opportunity for us.  And then in regard to international, Vasu will talk more about it, but that is absolutely the largest portion of our growth in this coming year. But it's largely been constrained by our other issues. Vasu?\nVasu Raja: Yeah, that's right. I'll pick up from there. I appreciate your longwinded philosophical question. My boss tells me that I'm prone to be longwinded and philosophical, but I'll be very focused and philosophical for this one. Because this is a topic that we've thought about for really a long time since the start of the pandemic.  First to pick up where Robert left off. When you look out, though our capacity mix is about 75% to 80% short haul versus long haul, 80% of our growth as we head into the next quarter is really all, what we call, the build back of the long haul network on a more efficient fleet base. That's the start of more \u2013 as indeed more airplanes come from Boeing.  But also, what's very important to note is we very consciously went and built our fleet and our network through the pandemic, so that it can go and be nimble and produce a level of earnings growth across the business cycle. So, importantly, when you look at us, right, versus 2019, we are about 45 widebodies smaller, 45 narrowbodies larger. That's material, because in the long haul business, and we've seen this over time, it's the most volatile part of a relatively volatile business, its most capital intensive part of a capital intensive business. And it can be very complex operationally, too. So what we found is that, actually, by being a very focused operator, a simplified fleet, things like that, that enables us to go and respond to demand a lot more appropriately.  So further to that, to what Robert said, the way we go about doing that is actually by making as many unique origin and destination markets as we can. And our primary asset for doing this is the large narrowbody, whether it fills widebody jets or fills regional jets. And the more of that connectivity we can make, the better it is.  So what you'll see in our international network, you see it already, is really an orientation around places where we can leverage our domestic strength. For example, Dallas, Fort Worth, or Charlotte which will have four trips to London this summer, or markets where we can leverage our partnership network. We'll fly JFK to Doha where we're able to connect to the entirety of the Qatar Airways network, for example.  And we grade that performance really, are we generating as a system? Are we generating more industry revenue, more of our share of industry revenue versus capacity share? And when you look back at the last four or five quarters, that's certainly been the case. At large, we're able to collect more revenue than the capacity share that we're flying. So we're encouraged by that.  This summer in long haul is going to be a seasonally and probably a historically strong long haul summer. Over time, that is going to go and normalize. And we will be able to grow into that and we will have a fleet that enables us to go serve it as and where the demand is.\nRobert Isom: One other piece of kind of real news on top of that. To add to that O&D base, and I mentioned the 150 aircraft that we're not flying from a regional perspective, I think that we've seen the low point of supportability. And as we take a look for through the rest of the year, and that's going to be built back. And I don't know if we'll be back to probably 100 aircraft again. But I look out over certainly the next 18, 24 months to be in a much better position just from utilization and also being able to service on these smaller cities and contributing to what Vasu had said from a philosophical perspective. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Vasu, maybe sticking with the philosophical a little bit. I'm sure this is still a real tough time to give some revenue projections. I guess when you sat down with your team over the last couple of weeks, which entities today are easier to forecast, but maybe some others aren't?\nVasu Raja: That's an excellent question. Look, this business is nothing, if not dynamic. Look, in our system, there's probably a lot more forecast clarity in our short haul network than our long haul network due not exactly to any particular demand trends, but just simply to the fact that we've been operating a big domestic system for a really long time.  So if you go back and look at last year, the demand environment in domestic, it was strong as we headed into the second quarter, it was made stronger by the fact that so many long haul markets were \u2013 they were either closed or it was really difficult for customers to go through.  But by being big last year and by continuing to be much bigger than what many other airlines were, it gave us a better sense for any amount of demand projections, both things such as the \u2013 how far from departure the booking curve is, how we can position our network based on demand changes, changing customer profiles and tastes. So right now, there's probably a little more accuracy around the short haul network than the long haul network.\nAndrew Didora: Just a second question here. I guess more near term. Just any update this morning, I know you reiterated your full year capacity and earnings goals, but nothing around revenues or costs. Have your thoughts here changed at all? Are you just kind of holding in the historical revenue yield relationship? \nDevon May: Yeah, I'd just say we're pretty early in the year for an update on either revenue or fuel. So we're leaving those out. I will say on a CASMx fuel basis, we still feel really good about our initial guidance of CASM, up two to five for that period. I think we'll be right around the midpoint of that, at least as we sit here today. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: It feels like the next kind of 12 to 18 months are going to be pretty important for managed corporate as a lot of the kind of old grandfathered enterprise corporate contracts come up for renewal. And you already have a few more competitors potentially kind of enter the game and maybe the size of the pie is also a little bit smaller, at least in the short term. How are you guys thinking about where American is positioned relative to kind of some of the enterprise, historically, competitors, as well as some of the new entrants and kind of going after that managed corporate share?\nVasu Raja: This is Vasu. And I'll pick up your question with reference to some of my early comments here. And our customers have changed and probably where that change is the greatest is with contract and corporations. So, in 1Q 2019, our mix of business revenue, I said they were 40%. That was kind of a two to one split between non-contracted customers and contracted customers. Now what we're seeing, what we've been seeing is that relationship is more like a three to one split between non-contracted customers and contracted customers. So there's the nature of the travel that's out there has changed a lot.  But also, the way in which we think about corporate has changed as customer tastes have changed. And if you think about it, for so many corporates, really when companies aren't back to work, it's really hard to go and get people back on the road. And we see that. So, where we are today, 95% of our corporate accounts are telling us that they're not enforcing a travel policy in which they require an employee to fly one airline versus another. And across our contracted base, over 60% of our corporate contracts don't fulfill the volume and share goals that we've set out, which is completely understandable. The marketplace has changed. If companies are struggling to bring people back to the office, it's practical to think that it's difficult to get them back on the road.  But that said, to refer to my earlier comments, that same base of customers, though they may be traveling less on a contracted deal, they're actually spending more money traveling on the airline. And indeed, that base of customers are doing things \u2013 they're the ones who are most likely to acquire our credit card or where they have our credit cards. They're the ones most likely to go and drive up spending on it.  So we're actually really encouraged as contracts come up for renewal because it's a chance between us and some of these corporates to really figure out how we go and structure deals that are fit for the purposes that these corporations have today and tomorrow.  So we're encouraged by that. We think that the marketplace is changing very much, and we're looking forward to changing with it.\nRavi Shanker: Maybe just a quick follow-up. I know there's been some commentary on kind of domestic network on this call already. But just to put a fine point on it, I guess, given your US domestic exposure relative to your network peers, I know there's been lot of talk/speculation on the strength of the US domestic traveler. Any kind of definitive word that you can say about whether you're seeing that strength in demand continuing, the strength in RASM continuing? Are you starting to see cracks? Or people potentially kind of delaying or putting off trips domestically, that would be helpful.\nRobert Isom: Look, I would say this, Ravi. What we see out there is demand for travel has never been probably more aspirational, nor more intentional. That is, we see not just people continuing to book further in advance. They're doing things where they want to go put more spending on credit cards, they want to go earn more miles because they're aspiring to take future trips that are out there. And they're keen to find more ways to go and do that, especially as they may be \u2013 the companies may be requiring them to travel less. But there's also just a lot of intentionality of that, right?  What we've seen across our system is, if you look at our traffic composition, it's not just that there's no more same day trips, we've shifted about three points of our traffic mix from round trips to one ways where people are sometimes willing to pay a flexibility premium, so that they can structure their trip and their fare product in a manner that they like.  That's all to say that we do continue to see strength in the demand environment. Its year-over-year comps may be a little bit odd because for purely idiosyncratic issues, right? Last year, domestic was benefited by the fact that long haul markets were shut down, for example. But so far, we still see a really favorable demand environment, and we see at the actual unique customer level, a great degree of desire to travel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: The pushback I get on the free cash flow production at American is that it's somewhat temporary as CapEx kind of ticks up again in the future. In nothing to the magnitude that you had before in the re-fleeting phase. But why aren't we talking more about a long term return on invested capital target? Like, what goes into that thought process for you guys? Or maybe we're just too early in the balance sheet recovery phase? Just any thoughts there would be helpful.\nDevon May: Listen, to start, we are really excited about our potential for free cash flow production in 2023. And you're right, this is a year where we have lower CapEx than an average year and lower CapEx than we wanted to have this year. We had planned to spend a little bit more on aircraft CapEx. We just weren't able to get the deliveries in the way we wanted.  But this year, we think we will be something approaching $3 billion of free cash flow. That is inclusive of our labor agreements, which do have the potential of some sort of bonus pay. So we're proud of what we're producing this year.  Next year, I think we're going to have a really nice free cash flow story again, even though our aircraft CapEx does step up a little bit. And then longer term, I think this is a story that we hopefully will continue to talk about. We don't expect to have a need to go through a kind of massive CapEx cycle again. We expect a more normalized cycle of capital expenditures. And in that world, we should be able to produce free cash flow each year. And as for metrics like a return on invested capital metric, it is early in the recovery, but that's something that we would expect to talk more about in the coming years.\nConor Cunningham: You talked a fair bit about managed corporate travel, but I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about the small and medium business traveler out there. Obviously, been a huge important segment for you guys in the near term. Just curious, have there been any changing in trends or tendencies given the choppy macro backdrop, just any thoughts there would be helpful.\nVasu Raja: Yeah, that's a great question. And probably it's a segment of travel which is maybe neglected historically. Look, we see a lot of growth. Clearly, it's not just that people are traveling less on contracted accounts, but we're seeing people who are taking business style trips or even blended trips who have no corporate \u2013 no recognized contract corporate affiliation.  And really, probably the biggest thing to note there is that there's just a different set of buying criteria. There's value on flexibility to my earlier point that a lot more of those non contracted customers will look to buy one way trips in order to blend it or construct what they need to do.  And also, for those customers, they reflect a lot of the economic dynamics of the country and Robert kind of alluded to it in his earlier remarks at the top of this. So much of that demand is originating out of Sunbelt markets, Arizona, Texas, the Carolinas, Florida, places where we just have an inherent level of strength, and we endeavor to go build a fleet and a network structure to capitalize on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: I have two quick ones here. Just, Vasu, following on Helane's point on your answer to your question, what was the split between direct and indirect sales in 2019? Where are you today? And where do you think you are, say, a year-and-a-half, two years out?\nVasu Raja: Today, we're a little over 60% going direct, which is about a 10 to 12 points improvement versus where we were in quarter one of 2019. We anticipate being about 10 points larger than that by quarter two.  Now, importantly, we consider it being sold through our new distribution technologies also as direct because we're able to provide \u2013 for us, direct is really how do we provide the right level of retail experience, selling and servicing to the customer. So we anticipate that will grow and potentially be as much as 80 plus percent of the airline by the end of the year. And we certainly are doing all that we can to both encourage and incentivize people to make it something greater than that. So we remain pleased with how it's rolled out there.  To bolster that and come back to some points that Robert and Ganesh mentioned, part of what we're doing also is we're simplifying what we sell. There's a lot of cases where we've created a lot of revenue products for a customer that \u2013 customer behaviors that just don't exist anymore that required a lot of complications in servicing. Now, we can be a lot more simple, we can provide flexibility in a lot more ways, which ultimately will be a thing that is great for any travel agency looking to serve a customer. But understandably, those are only made possible through contemporary technology. And so, we anticipate that will also further fuel a change amongst customer behavior and ideally agency behavior too.\nMichael Linenberg: Just to clarify, you threw out 80%. But I guess. to be clear, it's almost \u2013 obviously, the NDC peace, but it's almost a bit of a hybrid direct/indirect because the GDSs are part of that solution, right? Is my interpretation right?\nVasu Raja: Yeah, that's correct. And you're very much right, Mike. And the reality is what the split is that takes us from 60 to 80 between direct and indirect. We don't entirely know yet. And if we look at it, certainly from the last three or four weeks that we've been really producing content for new distribution channels, we've actually seen \u2013 the primary growth outlet has actually been our app and our dot com. So as things change, it remains to be seen.  And again, so much of this is dictated by the taste of the customer. And many of those non=contracted business customers that I spoke about in the last question would love to go and purchase and consume our product through the app. So as our app improves, we anticipate there will be more and more of a shift. \nMichael Linenberg: Devon, just a quick one. The $211 million profit sharing accrual, I guess that covers part of last year, but was that entirely incurred in the March quarter of 2023? And when you give us CASMx, is that chasm CASM ex-fuel or is it CASM ex fuel and profit sharing? I just want to clarify that.\nDevon May: The CASMx guidance is just CASM ex fuel. As for the $211 million, that is for our profit sharing program for the year ended March 31. We do have a profit sharing program for 2023 that started January and goes through the entire 12 months of this year. So the $211 million is for effectively the last nine months of 2022 and the first three months of 2023. And that is going to be paid out in May. \nMichael Linenberg: Okay. But would that incurred 100% in the March quarter? \nDevon May: No, that was accrued throughout 2022.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of J.P. Morgan. \nJamie Baker: Vasu, continuing on the corporate question, we understand the shift to NDC3. And credit is absolutely due to American for having the IT capabilities that not all of your competitors do. But what I can't reconcile is the way that you appear to be backing away from corporates. And that's based on my conversations with travel managers across the country, what I've seen in the press, it feels like the new philosophy is that you're not pursuing corporates with the same vigor as in the past because, to me, that suggests the potential for share shift to United, to Delta.\nVasu Raja: And the lens to see a lot of our changes is through the actual user of the airline product, the end consumer. And that's been a thing where \u2013 if you just think about the big history of the airlines, it's been hard to just amass the data and see technologically like who the customer is. We distribute our product based on whether it was a fast schedule or a low price. And so much of what we did was trying to get people to go by the faster schedule because there is a premium on it.  But the changes have been meaningful, and none of the top 25 companies who were there in 2019 are any more than about 65% return to travel. However, the top customers, our earlier point, they're spending more on the airline than ever before.  Now, what that means for us is, especially in many cases where accounts aren't fulfilling or things like that, the nature of the corporate discount and the corporate contract is just changing. Maybe the best example that I can give is, through many of our contracts over the years, we granted a level of loyalty status to customers. Well, now what we find is people are willing to actually \u2013 especially non-contracted customers, many cases, the actual customer in the corporation is looking to go and earn more miles, and when they earn miles, they want to be able to redeem them, they want to be able to get their status benefits, they want all of those things to take place.  However, at our peak, we were giving away as much as 35% of our status members were through corporate exceptions. So that's a material amount, when you think about it. That's actually curtailing the customer experience of those people who are most using our product, some of whom work in the exact same corporation, but didn't travel as much before. They travel less than some of the people who are receiving the exception. So a lot less of this is backing away from it, but the marketplace has changed. And there's something that we can do with a lot of these travel managers, which could be a much better experience for all of their customers. Through all of these changes, they can have access to, frankly, a much more seamless and simple servicing solution where they can also go and get some distribution cost savings too.  So the change is never a thing which is all the way easy, but it is something where our customers are speaking and for them it's necessary.\nRobert Isom: Jamie, it's important for me to weigh in too. I know this is probably not the case. The nature of your questions suggests that's what our competitors are saying about us in the marketplace. And I'd just like to underscore that, yeah, hey, look, we're going to back things in a little bit different fashion, we're looking to better service, offer less \u2013 a much less complex product, seamlessness across the board. That benefits our relationship with the corporate customers. And we're out there in force and we're making sure that we're appealing to our largest customers and the way that they want to do business. And if there are changes we need to make, we're going to do it. But right now, I think that more than anything else, what we're doing is actually having an impact. And I'm pleased with where we're headed.\nJamie Baker: Devon, just a quick question on the labor cost accruals. I want to make sure I understand correctly. Those accruals \u2013 well, do the accruals include any changes in profit sharing formulas anywhere else in the P&L? Or is it simply a wage based accrual? Given your answer to Mike's question, I think that's the right answer. It's just a wage based exercise.\nDevon May: For what's in the second quarter, based on where we're at in negotiations and an assumption that we actually reached a tentative agreement this quarter, what we have in our guidance is an assumption that we will be at higher wages for our pilot workgroup for the quarter. Other work groups, we expect to reach tentative agreements later in the year. So there's no impact from those groups in the second quarter.  And as for profit sharing, no expected profit sharing changes this quarter, but we do have an expectation for a change in profit sharing for those workgroups in the back half year.\nRobert Isom: Jamie, let me add on here, too. I know that that was a question about real P&L items. But at the end of the day, we're going to end up with a contract that not only takes care of our pilots from a compensation perspective, but also quality of life. But the good news on that front is that, look, I think that we're going to be in a position where the changes that we're making are going to benefit not only our pilots, but the airline as well. So I look to changes that are being made as something that we'll be able to accommodate over time without a lot of impact to productivity.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Alison Sider of WSJ.\nAlison Sider: Just sort of curious on Boeing deliveries, kind of what what's coming next, what you're hearing on Dreamliner deliveries and whether 737 delays to summer are going to cause any issues? Are you having to thin out routes or cancel any routes or any kind of customer impact there?\nRobert Isom: I'll start and Devon can give you some particulars, but between the MAXes and 787s, I think we have approximately 20-some-odd \u2013 23 deliveries planned for this year. And certainly, we've had some delays in that. And we're concerned about potential delays impacting the summer as well. It looks like we're going to be minimally impacted.  But I'd just underscore this that anytime that there is a delay in delivery, especially for an airline like American right now, where we've really built an efficient fleet over the years, if this results in real impact to the airline and to our customers, we expect to fly those planes, we expect to fly them on time, and we have to make schedule changes, it impacts hundreds, if not thousands, of customers. Fortunately, with this latest issue with the MAX, we haven't had to make too many changes.  But I'd just like to underscore this. Boeing has been a great partner. Airbus is a great partner. But, look, at the end of the day, we need them to be incredibly reliable. We need to them to be better than what they've been. And I don't communicate very frequently with the Boeing senior management team. And we need them to get their act together. We need a very, very strong Boeing and we need them to be an incredible partner and we have all the confidence that they'll get there. Devon, did you want to add anything else in terms of the particulars.\nDevon May: Just a reminder, we have four 787 deliveries this year. We took one in the first quarter. We expect the next three in the next 30 days or so. And on the MAXes, we have 17 remaining, those will start to deliver over the next handful of weeks. The last two deliveries for this year are both NEOs and we got both of those in the first quarter.\nAlison Sider: And if I could just follow-up on sort of all the business travel talk on this call. You've talked about it a lot. But we have heard companies and agencies sort of complaining about some of the changes American has made? Are you seeing any market share shift? Or is that it just doesn't really matter in the same way it might have at one point?\nVasu Raja: This is Vasu. Look, from a given agency or another, we may see a little bit. But in aggregate, we're really encouraged by the revenue trends that that we see. Indeed, what we're seeing \u2013 and while probably many people in traditional travel distribution are adjusting to these changes, what we also see in other cases is end consumers really responding favorably.  So I mentioned earlier how many of our sales are going direct, but one of the things that we're encouraged by is, by the end of this month, over 60% of our servicing transactions are coming digitally. And we anticipate by the end of the year 100% of our transactions could be done digitally. So that's a really meaningful change.  So again, when you think about who those customers are that are increasingly traveling, whether they're traveling on a blended trip or a business trip or a leisure trip, it's kind of a second order issue. The more that we can give them a contemporary retailing experience, like what they get with anything else they buy, the more they value. We're seeing that over and over again. Our best channel for driving upsell is actually dotcom and the app, and it's consistent across our system. I'll give a for example. This will be relevant for you and even for Jamie's comment. It's not just a function of our domestic marketplace. But when we're seeing 10 to 15 points of transaction share shift out of travel agencies and into the direct channel, it applies in our long haul network, too.  So London-Heathrow, which for us has \u2013 our peak flights in London-Heathrow, the entirety of the premium cabin could have been sold outside of the dotcom at one point in time in the past. As we finish the first quarter here, about 40% of our sales in London-Heathrow premium cabin is coming from our direct channel. And so much of what's happening, when they're doing that, when customers are buying that is they're buying a product that they can go service themselves, they can change the seat assignment, they get the full value of not just the flexibility of the fare product, but the entirety of the servicing experience.  So actually, so many of our changes, we want to make that same thing available to all of our retail outlets. Wherever a customer wants to shop, we want them to be able to have that experience as well. And we know that many of our travel agency partners, our corporates want the exact same thing. But it calls for a different approach. And so, we are doing a little bit of innovation to go and get it to a different approach. But ultimately, it's something which benefits the end customer and it's going to create more choices for them. And frankly, more competition on how they buy travel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg.\nMary Schlangenstein: I wanted to ask, what are American's plans for taking advantage of the waivers that were offered in New York and DC by the FAA?  And then my second question is, Robert, you were talking about the parked regional jets and said potentially you might be able to get 100 of them back in service by the end of this year. So realistically, how many of those planes do you think will return to use and will a large percentage of them perhaps never be that flying for American?\nRobert Isom: Let me take that last one first, which is we would we would be flying virtually all those planes today, if we could. And you take a look at small cities throughout the country \u2013 Vasu can give you a more exhaustive list than this. But places like Green Bay and Santa Fe and Springfield, Missouri, Panama City, those are all places that would demand more service right now. And they really can only be served with regional jet. Now, at the end of the day, we do that to connect into the larger part of our network. So, which then impacts our hubs in our mainline aircraft and the international flying and everything else. So it's a positive overall.  To that end, the largest issue that we've been facing is the shortfall in pilots. But we've seen great uptake in terms of people coming into the business because of some of the changes we made in compensation last year. And we're getting to the point where we have enough captains to build hours with first officers to get aircraft back up in the air. And when we take a look at where we'll eventually be, I would anticipate that virtually all those aircraft would be back into the system outside of the retirements that we would make for aging aircraft. \nVasu Raja: Regarding New York FAA, I can start, Mary, and Nate Gatten may want to add as well. But the short answer is, we're really encouraged by what the FAA did. For us, we've taken some advantage of it. But for us, so much of our growth in New York is really in JFK flying long haul. Think, Kennedy to Delhi or Kennedy to Doha. A lot of the benefits are more going to be borne out on people who fly shorter haul markets, higher frequency, where those issues can come and buy some more.  So when we go into our summer, our New York will be about 10 or 15 departures down versus what we had in the plan three or four months ago, but our overall seat capacity is up. And across the NEA, it is up and will continue to be up as we both get more people to New York, through New York and from New York.\nDevon May: I would just add, Robert mentioned it this morning, but we appreciate the FAA's leadership here to proactively take steps like this one to improve our airspace. Certainly, we've seen since the pandemic that the New York area airports have struggled to return to normal operations. A lot of that is because of workforce challenges and the other system constraints at those airports.  So the steps, we welcome. Vasu mentioned our ability to take advantage of this is limited to some extent by NEA. I would just say, as a part of the NEA, we committed to capacity targets for New York airports. And we expect to fulfill those commitments.  And I would just add, since we're on the subject that we also want to commend the FAA for their guidance around commercial space launches, which will now take into consideration the impact that these major launches in particular will have on air travel. It's a collaborative effort to address an issue that really challenges the system. And hopefully, it's something that's going to have wide ranging benefits to the traveling public.\nMary Schlangenstein: It sounds like you're not taking full advantage of the slot waivers offered by the FAA. Is that correct?\nVasu Raja: Mary, this is Vasu. That is correct. But that largely is due to the fact that we have less flying in the sort of high frequency markets that would most benefit from it.\nMary Schlangenstein: But as Devon said, you're not cutting under the NEA.\nVasu Raja: No. Indeed, we're actually growing seats. When you when you look at American Airlines this summer, we're growing seats and we're growing them at a greater rate than anybody else. The NEA is growing at a greater rate than anybody else. But that's really a response to consumer demand. And what you are seeing from us is flying fewer departures with more seats per departure. So we're able to across the NEA operate schedules that we can deliver on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC. \nLeslie Josephs: I'm just curious what the timeframe is for the new suites for the widebodies and, I guess, XLRs aren't here yet? Are you still expecting those to debut in 2024 and if there's any change to the retrofit schedule because we've seen some issues with supply chain? And then also, do you have any detail on what the upsell has been to more premium cabins, whether it's some more extra legroom seats or paid first and business class?\nVasu Raja: This is Vasu. I can answer both. So, the first question, no change to plans. We anticipate taking \u2013 installing the new seat on retrofits as planned and putting them on new deliveries as planned also. And we're really excited for it because it's going to be a really great product for our customers and a much simpler seat to go operate and deliver.  To your second question about upsell rates, look, a year or two ago, one of the questions in our mind, earlier point about philosophically how do we think about the long haul business, but one of our great concerns was what was the future of premium cabin, premium economy, things like that.  Now that we've had a year of seeing how people use this, even in a world where we have less corporate contracts flying, we've been actually really encouraged, probably never been more encouraged by premium cabin performance. So if you look at us in first quarter, our premium cabin revenues across the system are up 20% versus the same period in 2019. But our premium cabin seats are basically flat to what they were in 2019. That's a level of growth which exceeds what we see in the economy cabin, and we see it categorically across every entity that's there, domestic, short haul, Caribbean, London, even the Pacific, we see that.  So, actually, we've been very positively surprised by premium cabins, by the flexibility and the upsell that ends up happening. And indeed, to my earlier comments through the call, the fact that so many customers are willing to go and purchase this is, frankly, what makes us more encouraged about any number of the commercial changes we're making.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?\nRobert Isom: Thank you very much. And thanks for the interest. Look, we're really pleased with the progress that we've made at American. We set out with the goal of becoming a more reliable airline and becoming profitable. And we've done a remarkable job. Our team has done a remarkable job over the last year of getting us into this position \u2013 industry-leading operational reliability and then profitability, which is our fourth quarter in a row, record revenue production.  When I take a look year-over-year, it's astounding that we're $2 billion in terms of pre-tax \u2013 better than we were just a year ago. As project out for the year, we anticipate record revenues in the second quarter. So all that is very positive.  But I get asked questions about why isn't our stock price performance moving in alignment with seemingly improved prospects. And in fact, our guidance for the year in terms of EPS from analysts would be 25% below where we're guiding. Can I just say to that right now? No luck. It's due to people not knowing the American story, possibly. And in that case, we've got to get out and do a better job of letting folks know what we see and where things are headed. And if it's not that, they don't believe our story. In that case, we're just going to keep producing. Every quarter that we have a chance, we're going to talk about those things that are most meaningful to creating shareholder value. And that's earnings and generating free cash flow. And we'll keep producing until people do believe.  And for those that just want to see another chapter of the book and have some concerns about some issues that we may encounter over the next three, six months or so, hey, we'll play that out too. We're really confident no matter what comes our way that we'll react in a fashion that still preserves our focus on making sure we run reliably and ultimately profitably as well.  So I appreciate everybody's interest, and we'll get back to work. Thanks very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Managing Director of Investor Relations, Scott Long. Please go ahead.\nScott Long: Thank you, Atif. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. On the call this morning, we have our CEO, Robert Isom; our Vice Chair, President of American Eagle and Strategic Advisor, Derek Kerr; and our new CFO, Devon May. A number of our other senior executives are also on the call for the Q&A session. Robert will start the call this morning with an overview of our performance and our 2023 priorities. Derek will follow with details on the fourth quarter and full year, and Devon will then outline our operating plans and outlook going forward. After Devon's comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And before we begin today, we must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast of capacity and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, the numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.  In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information we're giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thanks for your interest and for joining us this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This morning, American reported a fourth quarter GAAP net income of $803 million and a full year net income of $127 million. Excluding net special items, we reported a fourth quarter net income of $827 million and a full year net income of $328 million. Our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year was driven by continued strength of demand and revenue environment and incredible efforts of the American Airlines team. We're tremendously proud of what the team has accomplished over the past year. We're committed to running a reliable operation, and we're delivering. Coming out of the holidays, American had the best completion factor of any major U.S. airline. We also said we would return American to profitability, and we've done that as well. Our team has delivered a third consecutive quarterly profit and fourth quarter margins that are higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 despite our fuel price increasing by approximately 70%. We generated nearly $2.4 billion in pre-tax profits over the past three quarters, and we're pleased to report a full year profit for the first time since 2019. In addition to running a reliable operation and generating sustained profits, we're making significant progress on repairing our balance sheet. We recently prepaid a $1.2 billion term loan a year before scheduled maturity date, and we have now reduced our total debt by more than $8 billion from peak levels in mid-2021. This puts us well past the halfway point of our $15 billion total debt reduction goal only 18 months into the program. Derek will talk more about our deleveraging plans in just a few minutes. Let's talk more about the fourth quarter and full year results. We produced revenues of $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 16.6% versus 2019 and the highest fourth quarter revenue in company history. Notably, we achieved this record revenue while flying 6.1% less capacity than we did in the fourth quarter of 2019. American also produced record revenues of $49 billion for the full year, which is a 7% increase over 2019, while flying 8.7% less capacity. Demand remains strong and our revenue performance is in line with our expectations following our strong holiday performance. Post-holiday bookings are off to a strong start. In fact, this is our best ever post-holiday booking period with broad strength across all entities and travel periods. Demand for domestic and short-haul international travel continues to lead the way. We expect a strong demand environment to continue in 2023 and anticipate further improvement in demand for long-haul international travel this year. Now turning to the operation. The American Airlines team delivered a fantastic performance in the fourth quarter. We operated more than 475,000 flights in the quarter with an average load factor of approximately 84%, and we ranked first in completion factor among the nine largest U.S. carriers. Our team delivered an even stronger performance over the holidays, despite challenging conditions in many parts of the country. American outperformed the industry over the December holiday period, ranking first in completion factor. Key to our success has been sizing our airline for the resources we have available and the operating conditions we expect to encounter. And we will continue to do that going forward. We're doubling down on our efforts to run a reliable operation in 2023, including investing in our team, our fleet and technology to support our operations and we're seeing this work pay off as our operation is off to a strong start just a few weeks into 2023, including the best on-time arrival performance of the nine largest U.S. carriers so far this year. American is proud to operate the simplest, youngest and most efficient fleet among U.S. network carriers. In August, we began taking deliveries of new 788 aircraft from Boeing for the first time in 15 months. In the fourth quarter, we took delivery of five 788s, and we expect to receive the remaining four in the first half of 2023. Our Boeing 789s are expected to be delivered starting in 2024. During the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry about that. Okay. During the fourth quarter, we also took delivery of seven A321neos, three 175s and three -- and five 737-800s from long-term storage. Devon is going to talk more about that. But what I'd like to say is that the results the American Airlines team produced in 2022 and what we are projecting in 2023 are proof positive that the actions we have taken in the recent years have put us in a position of strength and allowed us to take full advantage of the recovery. We spent more than five years on the most complex integration in the history of the airline industry. Three years navigating the pandemic and making the airline more efficient. And now we're poised to drive the business forward in 2023 and beyond. We have simplified and harmonized our fleet, modernizing our facilities, fine-tune our network to focus on the most profitable plan, develop new partnerships, introduced new tools for our customers and team and hired tens of thousands of people. During all, the American Airlines team has gone above and beyond to deliver strong operational and financial results. Now before I turn it over to Derek to provide more detail on our 2022 financial performance, I want to thank him for his partnership over the past 20 years as CFO. He is a great friend and he's been a trusted advisor throughout my career. Quite simply, he's the best CFO in the history of the airline industry. This financial leadership has helped create the largest airline in the world through the mergers of America West and U.S. Airways in 2005 and U.S. Airways and American in 2013. Derek was instrumental in raising $25 billion of capital during the pandemic to ensure American would not just survive, but also be in a position to thrive on the other side of it. And I'm very pleased that Derek will remain as American, Vice Chair and continue to lead our American Eagle and cargo teams and serve as a strategic advisor to the company. As we look forward to 2023, we remain focused on running a reliable operation, achieving sustained profitability and reducing debt. We have made tremendous progress in all three of these areas, thanks to Derek's leadership, and we will continue to sharpen that focus with Devon May as our CFO. And on behalf of the entire American Airlines team, I want to thank Derek for his leadership and tremendous contributions to the airline as our CFO. And now, I'll hand it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr : Well. Thank you, Robert. Thanks for your kind words. I really appreciate it. It's been an honor, tremendous honor to serve as CFO of American, U.S. Airways and America West over the past 20 years. I'm incredibly proud of what the team has accomplished in that time. Now on to the business of the morning. Excluding special items, we reported a fourth quarter net income of $827 million or earnings of $1.17 per diluted share. We produced our best fourth quarter pre-tax margin since 2016 when we produced roughly the same results at fuel prices that were nearly double the price per gallon lower than 2022. Throughout 2022, you heard us talk about our focus on returning the airline to profitability, and we have done that. We achieved a full year profit due to continued demand strength and the hard work of our team, despite a $1.9 billion pre-tax loss in the first quarter. Excluding net special items, we produced a full year net income of $328 million or $0.50 per diluted share. Fourth quarter revenue far exceeded our initial guidance due to continued strong demand. Revenue in the fourth quarter was higher than any fourth quarter in company history. As Robert mentioned, the domestic and short-haul international entities continue to lead the way, and we expect further improvement in long-haul international as we continue to grow back our capacity. Costs for the quarter, excluding fuel came in at the high end of our initial guidance range, primarily due to higher profit sharing expense driven by higher earnings in the quarter. American is proud to operate the simplest, youngest and efficient fleet among U.S. network carriers. In August, we began taking deliveries of our new 788 aircraft from Boeing for the first time in 15 months. In the fourth quarter, we took delivery of five 788s, and we expect to receive the remaining four in the first half of 2023. Our Boeing 789s are expected to be delivered starting in 2024. During the fourth quarter, we also took delivery of seven A321neos, three E175s and reactivated five 737-8s from long-term storage. In 2023, we expect to take delivery of two A321neos, and we plan to reactivate nine more 738s from long-term storage. Based on our latest guidance from Boeing, we now expect to take delivery of 17 737 MAX 8s in 2023 compared to Boeing's contractual commitment of 27 deliveries. This change in timings will shift planned CapEx out of 2023 and into future years. Our 2023 aircraft CapEx is now expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Repairing our balance sheet remains a top priority, and our actions in the fourth quarter show our commitment to debt reduction. In the fourth quarter, we repaid $1.2 billion term loan secured by domestic slots. This prepayment increased estimated first lien borrowing capacity to $10.3 billion and addressed our most significant 2023 maturity. With the actions we have taken, we have now reduced our total debt by $8.2 billion or more than half of our goal to reduce total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025, only 18 months into our deleveraging program. We ended the year with $12 billion of total available liquidity.  We will continue to balance both debt reduction opportunities and investments in the business while meeting appropriate target liquidity levels. We will target $10 billion to $12 billion of total liquidity in the medium term and intend to utilize excess liquidity to accelerate our deleveraging initiative at the appropriate time. With no meaningful maturity towers until 2025, we have the flexibility as to how and when we begin to address those instruments. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our new CFO, Devon May, who will share our outlook for 2023. Devon has more than 20 years of airline industry experience across finance, operations, network planning and alliances, and he is the perfect person to lead our finance organization going forward. He has been an integral part of our executive team for more than a decade and has built a great team around him. The CFO transition has been and will continue to be a seamless one. With that, I'll turn it over to Devon.\nDevon May : Thank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into our guidance, I want to start by thanking Derek for his leadership over the past 20 years. I've had the privilege of working with Derek since 2002 when I joined America West Airlines. He has been a close brand and mentor during this time, and our airline is set up well for the future because of his leadership. I'm honored to be taking on the CFO role and being part of an incredible senior leadership team. I look forward to leading the finance team and building on the progress we've made on our financial priorities. For 2023, we will continue to size the airline for the resources we have with a focus on reliability and sustained profitability. We continue to expect to produce capacity that is 95% to 100% of 2019 levels or up approximately 5% to 8% year-over-year. We are on track to hire over 2,000 mainline pilots in 2023, and we expect to achieve our run rate level of training throughput in the back half of this year, allowing for further aircraft utilization improvements in 2024. We continue to expect regional pilot affordability to be constrained throughout this year and next. Demand for air travel strengthened as we went through 2022, and we expect industry revenue will return to its historical share of GDP in 2023. Given our level of capacity production, the strength of our network and industry supply constraints, we expect total unit revenue to be up low single digits year-over-year. For the full year, we expect CASMx to be up 2% to 5% versus 2022. These projections include the estimated impact of anticipated labor agreements, which account for roughly 3 points of CASMx fuel. For the full year, we expect to produce earnings of $2.50 to $3.50 per diluted share. Using the midpoint of that EPS guidance, we are forecasting operating cash flows of approximately $5.5 billion and free cash flow of nearly $3 billion. Looking to the first quarter, we expect to produce an operating margin of between 2.5% and 4.5% based on our current demand and fuel price forecast. And while we are eager to get new labor agreements ratified given where we are at in the quarter and the time required for ratification, we do not anticipate ratifying new contracts prior to the end of the first quarter. If that does occur, we will update our guidance accordingly. In the first quarter, continued strength in demand is expected to result in total revenue per available seat mile that is 24% to 27% higher year-over-year. Our first quarter CASM, excluding fuel and net special items, is expected to be flat to down 3% year-over-year. The current fuel forecast for the first quarter assumes a fuel price of between $3.33 and $3.38 per gallon and a full year price of between $3 and $3.10 per gallon. As Derek noted earlier, we'll continue to focus on debt reduction, and I'm proud of the progress we have made to date. In 2023, we expect to make further progress on our $15 billion debt reduction goal. We will use our free cash flow to pay down $3.3 billion in debt amortization this year, and we expect that by the end of 2023, we will have reduced total debt by $10 billion to $11 billion from peak levels in mid-2021. Based on the forecast I just provided, we expect that by the end of the first quarter, we will have lower net debt and better net debt to EBITDAR than we did at the end of 2019. And by the end of the year, we anticipate having the lowest net debt-to-EBITDA ratio we have had since 2017. In conclusion, in 2023, we will continue to focus on delivering on our stated objectives. We are set up to run a reliable airline, grow margins and strengthen the balance sheet. Importantly, American is uniquely positioned to deliver substantial free cash flow in 2023. The confidence in our ability to execute on these goals is due to our world-class network and incredible team. With that, let's open the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. \nHelane Becker : Derek, I'm going to miss you, but good to know that you'll still be at the company. \nDerek Kerr : Thanks, Helane. \nHelane Becker : Sorry about Michigan. So here's\u2026 \nDerek Kerr: Just business, Helane. \nHelane Becker : Yes. Yes. So here's my question actually. Two. The first one is on CapEx. The one -- the guidance that you gave for CapEx seems low in light of the fact that you're taking four 787-8s this year. Is that a mix where it's leased versus owned in there?\nDevon May: Hi, Helane. Yes. This is Devon. That is what's happening with CapEx this year. So we're taking delivery of 23 airplanes, four of those are 788s, which are direct leased. So those four are not included in the CapEx guidance.\nHelane Becker : Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then just for my follow-up question. As you're thinking about long haul international, do you see in your bookings -- I think you mentioned that you think it will improve as the year goes on, do you see that in bookings that's already starting to occur at some point in first or second quarter? \nVasu Raja: Hi, Helane. This is Vasu. Yes is the short answer. We very much see it in bookings. It's -- we started seeing it, frankly, in Q4 of last year. In Q1, we see continued strength across all of the geographies that we have and that's continuing out into the summer. So we are very encouraged by the trends that we're seeing, all the more encouraged because it is coming often at lower cost of sale, and we're still filling business class cabins and things like that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs. .\nCatherine O'Brien : I also want to add my congrats to Derek on a wonderful career. And then just on your operational performance really stood out during the issues the industry experienced over the holidays. Obviously, it wasn't anything geographical considering what happens to some of your peers. So can you walk us through what you think drove it? Were there investments being made behind the scenes over the last couple of years that maybe just got smaller billing in the aircraft investments?\nRobert Isom : Catherine, thanks. Hey, we're really proud of the operating performance. I'll tell you, it's something that we've been working on a long time. And it starts with making sure that we have the resources available to fly the schedule and we don't put out a schedule that we're not confident that we can really fly. That's where we start. And then, yes, it's investments in so many different places. We benefit from having the youngest, most efficient fleet of aircraft. We spent a tremendous amount of time investing in technology to make sure that we can identify where our crews and our planes and our maintenance requirements are. But really, I want to give credit to the team here. We have so much experience on board that we're just really watchful, and it all came together over the holidays. The investments that we've made, the team that we have out there, making sure that we have the right schedule. I've got David Seymour here as well. I probably want to add to it. Look, there's a lot of good decision-making going on out there, too. \nDavid Seymour : Yes, Robert, emphasizing the point you talked about. But another key item here is for these storms and we've been very focused on recovery after that because it's so critical to us is one that I think throughout this year, we're doing better and better on and we certainly showed that over the holiday. But the key for us, along with having more new positions that we put in that are focused when we have storms like this. We've changed a lot of our processes and procedures that we -- and how we manage these. And then we've also been partnering with our IT group and really enhancing some of the technology resources that we have to manage through these events because they change very dynamically and very quickly, and we have to stay in front of them. But more importantly is the recovery. We started looking at the forward look of what the storm potentially could be and started building our recovery plan before the storm yet, and that's where we're very focused on. So again, as Robert said, very proud of the team, very proud of the partnership with all the whole airline because it's not just operations. It's a lot of our support groups that are very critical to us getting through these. So there's a great job. We're going to continue to improve on that.\nRobert Isom: And Catherine, it just -- it speaks to what we're going to be focused on going forward as well. It's still reliability and profitability here, and we're going to try to get better every day. Today, we have another 5,000-plus flights and 0.5 million customers that we have to service. And so we make it make it our business to take care of people every day. So we're back out there in business. .\nCatherine O'Brien : That's great. That's a group color. If I could just sneak one more in. Maybe for Vasu. Can you just help us think about some of the assumptions that drive your full year revenue outlook? Like what are the assumptions on business international recovery? Is there an assumption in there that the industry is going to pass on higher price of labor and fuel on a one-one basis? Just any thoughts to drive the full year revenue outlook? \nVasu Raja: Absolutely. I would be happy to do that. Look, first of all, in our revenue forecast, we don't assume any change to some of the fundamentals of airline demand. We presume that airline industry revenues will regain its historical relationship with GDP, roughly about a point of percent. We also presume the same historical relationship between revenue and fuel prices. But what is very important is that as we've talked about for some time, what's different about us is that we have used the last few years to really materially change our network, our partnerships and our fleet and that really bleeds through in our forecast for next year. If you compare our capacity mix just in future schedules that we have published to what we did in 2019. We've taken 5 points of capacity out of our lowest RASM, lowest-margin long-haul flights, and we've grown 5 points of capacity in our highest-margin short-haul flights. Additionally, within the short-haul system, we've taken 5 points of capacity from some of our lowest performing, lowest RASM market and redeployed it into our Sunbelt hub, which are not just our highest RASM market, but some of the highest rosin markets in the industry. So when you think about that, that's 10 points of capacity mix that we've taken from truly the lowest RASM, lowest margin things and put into some of the highest margin things that that are out there. And you're seeing some of that trend already through '20. So that was a thing that have been in our past schedules. You see it in our quarter one schedules, and that drives a lot of our revenue performance.  Now to put that into a bit of focus, 10 points of capacity in an airline of our size. You can think of that as larger than just about any airline hub with the exception of DFW, Charlotte and maybe one or two other hubs that our competitors operate. So that is a material reworking of our airline network over the last few years. But what's just as important is how we have done it, which is really to a significant amount of fleet simplification. So we -- over the last few years, we've shed 50 long-haul capable airplanes, many of which were really inefficient, like the 757 to 767. We've up-gauged both the regional jet and the main lines that we've got. And we've simplified the airline down to four fleet types. So what that enables us to do is in the fleet that's left, we can much more dynamically alter schedules to follow where the demand is. But we can produce schedules that, as you heard David and Robert talk about, are a lot more operable and frankly, a lot more efficient. So we've seen the benefits of that in our recent revenue performance, and we anticipate the benefits of that in the year ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker : First, Derek, what a run you've had, just wanted to wish you the very best from the JPMorgan team as you transition. I still remember hanging up on you on October 24, 2003. Apologies again for that. Hopefully, it's\u2026 \nDerek Kerr : Thanks, Jamie. \nJamie Baker : A question for Vasu. So Southwest cited passenger cancellations didn't book away as part of its first quarter guide this morning. I'm wondering what the benefit for American in Dallas and Chicago might look like? And whether you see share tapering back to pre-December levels in March? Or do you think there's possibly a longer tail to any Southwest benefit that you might be picking up? After all, I mean you're on time and -- excuse me, you're on time and completion factors obviously speak for themselves over the holidays.\nVasu Raja: Yes. Hey, Jamie, thanks for the question. Look, we don't see any recognizable benefit from what other airlines are doing. For us, it really is as simple as when we go put the flights in places people want to go and operate it well. The bookings come the revenue materializes. And there's really not a lot of facts that we can point to beyond that very simple truth.\nJamie Baker : Okay. Fair enough. And a follow-up, Doug wasn't shy in discussing hub profitability, L.A., Miami and JFK being the real drags on margin, D.C., Charlotte, Dallas, the obvious standouts. And L.A. has obviously seen some rationalization. You have NEA contribution up here in my neck of the woods. I'm just wondering whether your internal model shows the range between your most and least profitable hubs narrowing? And if so, what the specific drivers might be? \nVasu Raja: Yes. So the short story is we do see an improvement in very many of our hubs as we've gone and restructured the network. And in some cases, like look, as you think about partnerships for us, we don't see those very differently from how we think about our own airline network. But when you put a codeshare flight number or an American Airlines operated flight number, it has the same effect of creating more network for customers, and there's a real benefit for it. But as much as anything -- there's two things going on. One, demographically, we see so much growth in the interior of the country. And two, what is really driving our hub profitability is for a great number of cities American Airlines has the best network for so many customers. There's 300 cities that we serve today. In 2019, we served roughly the same amount of cities. Most of our competitors have actually shrunk the number of cities that we've served. But furthermore, within the city that we have in about 200 of those 300 cities, we have a material schedule advantage to other airlines that operate there. So that creates an effect that is actually really beneficial across all of the hubs in our network, and indeed, some of how we see hub profitability and how these hubs work together has changed materially through the pandemic. And to my earlier comment, that's why we've restructured so much of the airline network as we have.\nVasu Raja: Jamie, you mentioned Los Angeles. So I'd like to pass you to expand on that a little bit. Look, in Los Angeles, we're within a limited amount of gates. And let's face it, we need to use those. We need to use those in a way that's profitable. We've taken a look at that. But we can tell you the kind of changes we make. Well, yes, look, in L.A. much like in New York, through our partnerships, we've been able to create something really cool for customers where -- if you think about it in the times past, we flew 50 seaters and small RJs in markets where we didn't really have a scheduled proposition for customers. And in both of those markets, take it L.A. and New York. Effectively, what we've done is we've turned 50 seaters, which are not particularly efficient and long haulers. 777s that are flying a whole lot further. So we've up-gauged in both of those markets materially. We've been able to use partnerships to go and offer a much broader network for customers. And now we're in this place where lo and behold, we're adding a third LA Heathrow because it's really -- to Robert's point, a very efficient way to go use gates and leverage what we've got with customers. In New York, so much of our growth is actually powered by long-haul flights that are flying within the partnerships that we have with Qatar, British Airways. And the net effect of that has been really positive outside of really good financial results, which we see in our revenue trends. For the first time ever, our top 2 markets for AAdvantage enrollments are New York and Los Angeles. We're signing up more credit cards there. We are originating -- we're having growing originating market share in those places. So a lot of what we've done is, frankly, up-gauge in those markets. We've gotten a lot smarter about what we do for customers. Yet at the same time, there are partnerships we can offer them so much more.\nJamie Baker : I'll sound like a broken record, but thank you yet again for such a thorough response. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. \nScott Group : So if I just look at the first quarter TRASM guide versus Q4 implies a much sort of bigger drop than normal sequentially Q4 to Q1. And just any thoughts, color there? And then I want to kind of ask that in the context of fuel. So spots obviously a lot higher than what you're guiding to. What's your confidence that you can recapture fuel with higher TRASM than you're already guiding to for the year?\nVasu Raja: Yes. Scott, this is Vasu. I'll start. I think Devon we'll finish this one out. Look, First and foremost, as we're starting this year, we have been really encouraged by demand trends. Historically, the first three weeks coming out of the holiday season are our strongest sales weeks these first three weeks have been the strongest that we've seen in the post-merger airline. And we're really encouraged by that. And you see that, of course, in our TRASM guide out there. Now what is interesting though is as we are building first quarter, what is different from times past is we have been very conscious in Q1 about how we use the airlines resources. It's people, it's planes, it's facilities, everything, largely so that we can have as much of that capacity for the summer peak as possible. So when you look at our Q1, we have peaked the airline a lot less than what we had historically. It's at a lower percentage of Q2 than what it's historically been. And that's really a conscious design. And you see that is really what you see in our Q4 to Q1 change that's there. And that's sort of a unique thing. And to my earlier point, we don't presume any change to the historical relationship between airline revenues and fuel prices. But Devon may want to add more to that, too.\nDevon May : Just really quick other comment on fuel price. So our -- fuel price forecast is based on Friday's close, where Brent was trading almost exactly where it's at today and then using the forward curve for Brent and he crack from there. So I think our forecast that we have delivered today is pretty much in line with where you always have or feel of that today.\nScott Group : Okay. And then just separately, can you just give any color on what you're assuming for the cargo and other revenue and then the non-op expense is up a good amount from the Q4 run rate? Any color there? \nDevon May : Yes, this is Devon. So just on cargo revenue, we are expecting it to be down slightly year-over-year. When it comes to non-op, the largest change we're seeing in non-op is due to a noncash pension credit that we got last year based on the prior year's market performance of our pension assets, and what were relatively low interest rates. This year, we saw interest rates increase. Pension assets came down and so this noncash credit that was fairly significant in 2022 is much smaller in 2023. And that's something that I'm sure you're hearing from other companies and seen in other industries.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg : Hey, Derek. I'm going to miss you. I know you're going to still do the company, but we've had a lot of fun over the years. Anyway. \nDerek Kerr : Thanks, Mike. \nMichael Linenberg : Next drink is on me. \nDerek Kerr: Boston trip, never forget the Boston. \nMichael Linenberg : Anyway. Just -- I have two here, if I could just start off with Vasu because I think we're trying to get our arms around the run-up in fuel and the pass-through. And I think Delta is out there sort of guiding to 50 -- or well, to exceed 60% of their revenue in premium and ancillary. And I think right now, they're in the mid-50s. And when I think about those revenue segments, many of them come with a price elasticity of demand that's less than 1. Many of them are the types of segments where you can have a fuel surcharge. And so Vasu, as you think about it, like sort of what percentage of your routes maybe are subject to fuel surcharges, whether they're international long haul or which ones are premium corporate, cargo. How should we think about like in round numbers, maybe what percent of your revenue where you stand a very good chance of passing on 100% of horizon fuel? Sort of where do you sit there? And just any color on how you guys think about it? \nVasu Raja: Yes. Hey, Mike, it's a great question. Look, I would actually even simplify it further. Look, in the airline network business, if you can offer something unique to the customer, they pay you a premium for it. It is as simple as that. And so -- and we see it time and time again, we've seen it do the pandemic the most unique thing we can offer customers is to take them to places where our competitors can't have better schedules than what our competitors can do. So as long as that's the case, we find that those routes regardless of whether customers purchase a transaction, which is first class or an economy or fly for leisure business, they always have yields that index to the top of our system. So if you think about us, right, to my earlier point, in 200 of the 300 cities that we serve in the Western Hemisphere, we have a material schedule advantage. But when you look at it on the number of origin and destination markets that we make and that turns into like something like 65% to 70% of our origin and destination markets. We have a material advantage over what our competitors are. That is what drives our revenue performance. And unsurprisingly, demand at large for the airline product is relatively inelastic. But in so many of those places, it is inelastic. We're also further benefited by just general trends that we're seeing so much of what is driving the economy and likely to continue to do so, are markets in the Sunbelt and the interiors of the country and less so the coastal markets, which creates an immediate benefit for American Airlines.  So we've benefited from that. We've benefited from how we can uniquely serve it, are likely to continue to be able to uniquely serve it. And when fuel prices rise, it's a really simple thing for us, with any number of ways to go and manage capacity down as the airline continues to produce.\nMichael Linenberg : Very good. And then just second question to Robert. All the talk about capacity constraints across the aviation ecosystem. And as I think about American, it feels like things like pilots and mechanics. Maybe that's not an issue. If you sort of think about like what are the big hurdles that you have from a constraint issue? And is it just that maybe you don't have enough wide-body airplanes and therefore, it's an issue with the OEMs delivering the airplanes that you need? Is it air traffic control, like where are you -- sort of where are the roadblocks that you're running into with respect to constraint in the aviation ecosystem?\nRobert Isom : Yes. Mike, thanks for that. And yes, we're in a environment of a lot of constraints coming out of the pandemic. We certainly saw everything last year, it's just things that we never thought we would have issues with pillows and link is in food and fuelers and things like that. We've gotten our arms around a lot of that. But what we have now is aircraft manufacturers that are just starting to get their feedback under them. I mentioned that Boeing is starting to deliver aircraft to shout out to the Boeing team and Dave Calhoun, we need them to keep it up. But there's constraints out there in terms of engines and aircraft. With -- at American right now, we have really an issue with regional aircraft and then some issue with mainline aircraft. On the regional side, it's largely a pilot constraint. And we're not flying the fleet that we'd like to. Vasu would actually like to deploy more aircraft. Now on that front, it's pretty explainable. It's just a shortfall in pilots. We didn't attract people into the business for a couple of years. And we're working our way through that as we have retirements that are coming out the other side. American took the monumental step last year of greatly increasing regional pilot pay. And I think that, that is the biggest thing that any company can do and has done to actually get the pump prime and people flowing back in. And we're seeing that. We're seeing that we've stabilized the pilot ranks at our regionals, and we see potential growth as we come through the end of the year. Now from a mainline perspective, look, we're going through the greatest training cycle of pilots that we've ever experienced. We had, I think, almost 900 retirements last year, probably nearly the same number this year. So we're stretching our training resources like we've never before. But fortunately, we plan for this. And so from an equipment perspective, like simulators, we've got those in place. One of the things that we're really working on is to make sure that we have the people resources and having the check pilots that we need to really address all of our training needs. And I'm hopeful that as we work with the APA and we get a new contract, but we'll be able to give even more flexibility. But overall, I do see from a mainline perspective, we should be through the constraints that related to pilots as we progress through the year. Regionals probably take a couple of years. But as we said, we have aircraft that we can deploy and will, and it's going to be done in a very efficient fashion. You mentioned some other areas that are absolutely positively out on the horizon, the large airports all have constraints, whether that's at the gate or on the airfield. And then we have aerospace issues. That clearly, we need to address. And that's going to take leadership. And fortunately, we're working with the DOT and FAA. And I know that the Secretary Buttigieg has an interest like we all do in making sure that we can invest for the future. And it's going to take a long-term view. But overall, look, these constraints right now are things that we're managing through. I think it bodes well, at least from a demand environment and being able to ensure that we can achieve profitability. And over the long run, we're going to make sure that we have a business model that works in any demand environment with any set of constraints.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham : Thank you. And congrats, Derek and Devon. It's great to hear. Just back to Jamie's question on the operation and maybe some of the Southwest issue. I'm just curious if you could speak to the converse, how your conversation with your corporate partners has evolved given your just operational strength. Like I would imagine it would be a lot easier in these days, but can you just talk about how that's how that's changed at all and what your expectation is for new contracts and so on.\nRobert Isom : Conor, I'll start, and I'm going to hand it straight off to Vasu. But I'll tell you what. One thing that hasn't changed is that reliability it translates into likely to recommend. It translates into Net Promoter Scores. And we see it over the holidays and as we really progressed through last year and and got reliability to a really high level, our scores have improved to the highest levels that we've seen. So those are the kind of things that I think that our corporate customers are interested in as well. Vasu?\nVasu Raja: Yes. Robert, it's 100% right. And -- so first, I'll say, for our customers at large, they clearly benefit from a better operation, and we see it -- for the year, we -- as Robert said, we posted our best likelihood to recommend scores by a meaningful amount in any time post-merger. And that's no action. That is the operation. But what's really important out there is, yes, many of our corporate partners are encouraged. But what's really important -- and this links back to some of the other questions is that also the marketplace has changed very meaningfully. As I mentioned on our last call, we see the same trends where roughly 30% of our revenues are coming from what we've historically called leisure. About 45% are blended trips. Only about 25% of what we've historically called business trips. And of that 25% -- historically, that number would have been about 35%. So it shifted a lot. And within the 25% only about 5 to 7 points of that are coming from contracted corporations. The rest are non-contracted, unmanaged businesses who are flying on us. And what we see amongst those contracted corporations is quite striking. Almost 2/3 to 75% of our corporate contracts are actually not fulfilling the terms of their contracts for understandable reasons. For so many companies, if you're struggling to bring people back to the office, it's hard to compel them to go do a day trip to Chicago or New York. And so we see that broadly. And so even though many customers are happy with our service and many corporate travel buyers are very happy with our service. The reality is same-day corporate business trips, which used to be 3% to 4% of our traffic is less than 1% of our traffic. And that's been out there for a while, and we are planning that that's going to be the new one.\nConor Cunningham : Okay. Great. That's one. And then on the -- if you're talking about free cash flow, again, that's obviously great to hear. I'm just curious how your expectation for future aircraft deliveries has changed. Are you -- should we expect that we're going to start paying cash for these planes going forward? I realize that your CapEx budget is lower. But just curious on how you're thinking about financing those aircraft in the future.\nDevon May : Yes. This year is a low point for aircraft CapEx. We'll see it come up a little bit next year and then get back to a type capital expenditures as we get out into 2024, 2025. In terms of financing, it's going to be dependent on where the market is at. And so -- yes, there is potential opportunity that we may pay cash for some airplanes, but it's dependent on what sort of free cash flow we are delivering and what sort of market rates we're able to achieve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon : Robert, I wanted to ask you about how we're exiting 2023 on the cost side. You guys have been running a pretty clean operation and the margins are obviously pretty healthy. I'm just wondering how much baggage are you carrying in the 2023 outlook from lower productivity, more full training classrooms. Is there a way to think about what that penalty would be from a unit cost perspective because of some of those lingering effects of restoring the network embedded inside of the 2023 guidance?\nRobert Isom : Well, I'm going to ask Devon to help me ask. But David, I would tell you that I think the biggest issue that we have right now is that we have aircraft that we could be utilizing it at a much higher level. And absolutely positively we're going through some training cycles that are just unprecedented. And as the hiring is going on at American right now, that is going to over time stabilize, and we won't have to work those assets quite as hard. Biggest thing right now is aircraft. Devon, do you want to give some numbers on what you think that...?\nDevon May : Yes. I'd just say for aircraft utilization, we are just starting to approach historical levels. So just starting to approach our 2019 levels of aircraft utilization as we get through this year. So like we've talked about, this is a fleet that should be able to produce higher aircraft utilization than the fleet we had prior to the pandemic. Just recall prior to the pandemic, we had a lot of older aircraft, smaller sub fleets that have really high spare ratios. So even though we will likely put more into operational support than we would have planned to a year or two ago, we still think this is a fleet that can produce significantly higher utilization than what we're doing today.\nDavid Vernon : Okay. I mean the leverage on the aircraft ownership cost is pretty straightforward. But as you think about increasing that utilization, Can you talk about the impact on the -- at the margin on costs and things like labor and the rest of the business? I'm just trying to get a lot of questions about scalability and and how unit cost should be moving as we're thinking about -- not just '23, but also '23 and '24. Any added color there would be helpful. \nDevon May : Yes. I think just as Robert said, there's certainly some more operating leverage in the business. And I'm asking specifically about the salary line or the training headwinds. I think that is absolutely a part of it as we get through this year and get our training throughput to a level that it should be. I think we are going to see some efficiencies on that side. Through the rest of the P&L, yes, there's opportunities as we increase aircraft utilization in areas like airport rent and landing fees, and that type of thing. \nRobert Isom: And in maintenance. When you have aircraft that sit on the ground, especially within our regional fleets, it's not as if those don't require maintenance. So look, the fleet meant to be flown and whether it's things like rents and landing fees, maintenance, those are the areas that I would probably look to most as being opportunities for us to see much greater efficiency.\nDavid Vernon : All right. And then one last real quick one. Free cash flow should be something like 130% of net income -- in this -- based on the guidance today. As you think about the go-forward look, I'm just curious about the -- whether you're able to use the losses in the last couple of years. How long is that going to affect sort of cash taxes? And where do you think cash taxes are going to start to become a part of the equation here? Is that a '24, '25, '26 thing? Or is that like any sense of when that might kick in? \nDevon May : Yes. We don't expect to be CapEx payers in that period for at least through 2026.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America. \nAndrew Didora : It's Andrew Didora. Just in terms of the balance sheet and the debt pay down, how the $8 billion gross paydown done thus far? Am I doing my calculations right, is about $3.5 billion of that coming from the pension? And then of the $15 billion kind of total gross debt paydown number, how much of that do you assume is just a reduction of pension benefit? .\nDevon May : Yes. So that is the right calculation. So in the summer of 2021, when we had historically low interest rates, our pension obligation is obviously significantly higher. It's been around $2 billion at the end of 2022. By the end of 2025, where we've set our $15 billion goal is still right around that number, maybe a little bit lighter based on expected asset returns and the pension contributions going to make.\nAndrew Didora : Got it. And I know you've answered a lot of questions in terms of asset utilization, hiring and things like that. But as you sit here today for your 2023 capacity plan, do you have the pilots and the aircraft in-house to hit that plan? Or does the plan require additional hiring and additional kind of deliveries from the OEMs relative to plan in order to hit that capacity goal?\nDevon May : We'll be hiring pilots throughout the year. We feel really good, though, about the hiring forecast we have and what we're expecting for training throughput. In terms of deliveries, as we talked earlier, we do expect to take 23 aircrafts this year. Those deliveries would be required to hit this plan. I think we've taken a pretty conservative approach to what we have for in-service dates. And we feel like this is the plan we're going to be able to hit.\nRobert Isom : Yes. And Andrew, that's -- look, this is -- Vasu and Devon get together to build the network and work with David and see more on our operating capacity. We're being really mindful of making sure that we have the resources to fly the schedule. So there's a confidence factor that we're using in that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Congrats to Derek and Devon. Just to follow-up, just where you left off there. I think at one point last year, I believe you paused mainline hiring because of the pilot training throughput and the pilot training lead times. Can you just mark to market like did you restart hiring? When did you restart hiring? And how many incremental do you need to hire to hit your growth plan this year? \nDevon May : Yes. So we were hiring ahead of needs and training throughput as we got later in the year. So we did pause hiring for most of the month of December, I believe. That hiring has resumed here in January. Our expectations are we're going to hire around 2,000 pilots for this year and probably a little bit on the higher end as we get through the year and training capacity continues to increase.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Okay. And then just most of my questions have been asked, but just an aircraft financing question. So hypothetically, if you had $100 million in aircraft CapEx and you debt finance that, where do you see LTVs? So is it -- is it $80 million or $85 million that would go on the balance sheet. Where do you see LTVs and cost of debt today? And alternatively, if you lease that $100 million of growth CapEx how much would go on the balance sheet in the form of an operating lease liability? \nDevon May : Okay. There's a lot to that. I'll say our treasury team right now, we have 23 deliveries, 12 of which are already financed. So our financing requirements for the remainder of this year, are pretty limited. But those are all the factors they're going to be looking at is what sort of rates are embedded in the operating leases that are in the market today, what the LTV, we can get on the debt. What's happening with the rest of the balance sheet and our free cash flow and they're going to make the right economic decision. So we have a great treasury team. They're looking at these remaining nine aircraft we need to finance for this year and looking out to 2024 as well.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Okay. I mean, fair enough. It's not like if you will, or if you won't. It's -- if you do debt finance $100 million in CapEx, where is the market in terms of that LTV and cost of debt today? \nDevon May : Yes. It's something that obviously, we expect is going to move around over the next handful of months. I don't have a number that I'm ready to give right here today, but it's something we're going to stay tight with. And we have a team that knows the market well.\nOperator: Our final analyst question before we open the line to media comes from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker : So one short-term and one long-term question. The short-term question is -- it's good to hear that you said you're having your best ever post-holiday booking period so far this year. Can you just expand a little bit more? Are you seeing any changes in customer behavior? Are they flying to different destinations? Are they looking to maybe kind of downgrade their tickets or look for more flexibility, kind of any signs at all of any change in customer behavior or kind of in where macro is?\nVasu Raja: Yes, we are seeing some changes in customer behavior. People are -- especially leisure travelers are looking even further out. We see that the blended customers are also much more willing to book further out. And third, we see that customers, especially blended customers or people purchasing a blended trip are more willing to buy higher-value fair products and shop direct with us. So we continue to see a world where roughly 60-ish percent of our revenues are coming direct to us through our dotcom and mobile app, and we see that continuing to grow. Furthermore, as those blended trips come in to our, as we call them, owned channels, 70% of the people shopping for the lowest fare end up buying a higher fare than that. So we're encouraged by that. And then as far as where people are flying, I suppose that's pretty simple, too. They're flying everywhere they possibly can, except for places in Asia.\nRavi Shanker : That's great to hear. And maybe just a follow-up. You guys have come a really long way kind of in the last year kind of since where everyone was doing the pandemic. But the markets may be not recognizing that. So I'm wondering if there's any plan to kind of host an Analyst Day to kind of give us a kind of a long-term plan on strategic priorities, long-term financial guidance as such?\nRobert Isom : Ravi, thanks for that question. The answer to that is, look, we've been really pleased with the work that we've done throughout the pandemic and setting American up. And the answer to your question is yes, we're going to get out and make sure that people know our story. More details on that as time progresses, but you'll hear more from us on that.\nOperator: At this time, we'd like to open the line to our media questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg.\nMary Schlangenstein: Good morning, everybody, and congratulations to Derek and Devon. I wanted to ask a couple of business-related questions quickly. On your business travel, whether it's corporate managed or not, do you anticipate any impact from the growing number of companies that are laying off workers, particularly in high tech, but also now extending to some manufacturing companies? And then my second question is, is your expectation that this shift to blended trip is, in fact, the structural change within the industry and will not diminish going forward in terms of at least as far out as you can see?\nVasu Raja: Thanks, Mary. This is Vasu. And I'll answer the questions in reverse order. First, look, there is -- we do see a meaningful change in the trip purposes that people are booking that there's a lot more blended trips even so many people who are searching for what conventionally would have been a business style itinerary. We see it in our dot-com end up selecting something which is pretty unconventional or they stay a Saturday night or they book another person for a midweek trip or something like that. So we do see that. And our credit card partners at Citi see the same thing, too, that demand for travel is still a really strong category and as preserved -- a travel at large has preserved its relationship with GDP, if not somewhat grown a little bit. So that -- there is a meaningful thing we're coming out of the pandemic. There's clearly a value the consumer is placing on travel. Then as far as how layoffs are impacting things, look, what's really important to note about business travel is -- yes, it's 25% of our revenues, but those companies are intending to do the largest the biggest, largest ones tend to buy on a corporate contract. And that's -- so much of that business just really hasn't recovered. And we haven't built an airline plan around it. However, non-contracted business is 100% recovered, contracted business is about 75% recovered. And we don't presume that it grows much further than that. So we aren't seeing a really significant impact, but we also aren't building a plan based on a lot of that demand returning.\nMary Schlangenstein: And is that 75% recovery for contract? Is that down from prior estimates I thought that you had said perhaps 80% in the past?\nVasu Raja: It's hovered in the -- sorry, Mary. It's hovered in the 75% to 80% range. And to be conservative, we build our plan around the lower end of that.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. And that's revenue?\nVasu Raja: Correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Curious what your hiring needs are outside of the unionized groups like the offices? And if you're seeing any one apply or maybe you can benefit from some of the tech layoffs? And then secondly, with your plans to do this High-J configuration cabin, are you planning to increase staffing at all of cabin crews to kind of handle the more high touch service and more passengers in that cabin.\nRobert Isom : Leslie, I'll start and Cole Brown, our Chief People Officer, can help me out. Look, the hiring at American is really at unprecedented levels. You mentioned our pilot hiring, yes, we anticipate 2,000 pilots this year. But over the last two years, and Cole, correct me, I think we've hired almost 40,000 people, which is across all groups. We have a view that we're going to bring folks in, make sure that they're really well trained. But it really is throughout all of our operations and headquarters and administrative staff, and we're going to bring the best and the brightest in. So Cole, do you want to add anything to that?\nMecole Brown : Yes, Robert. I would just add to your point that we are taking a hard and thoughtful look as it relates to any hiring outside of operations making sure that we're bringing in the best and brightest, but also that we're thinking through not only what our needs are today or where we're going tomorrow. And some of those skill sets might evolve and change. We have an exciting new CIO that's come on board and is taking a really important look at our IT organization. And so more to come. But right now, we feel like we are focused on the right things and being very thoughtful and measured in where we are hiring at the corporate level. And certainly, the focus is the areas that we've previously discussed as well.\nLeslie Josephs: Got it. And then on the staffing for the High-J? \nVasu Raja: We're really -- this is Vasu. We're really excited for the new High-J product. Our customers love our new business class. And we've gotten great feedback as we've shared concept designs with some of our most loyal customers and our flight attendants. But we haven't yet determined a number of things with how it operates, where it operates, things like that too. So it's a little bit premature right now.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Claire Bushey of Financial Times.\nClaire Bushey: I was wondering if you're at all concerned about new regulation in response to perceived increasing unreliability of air travel.\nRobert Isom : Hey, Claire, I'll just start. Look, our primary focus is making sure that we run the best airline we possibly can. That's the way that ultimately we address customers' needs and ensure that our customers are being treated fairly. Of course, we'll work with government authorities to make sure that we're taking care of people in the right fashion. Nate, do you want to add anything? No? Good. Okay. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Cameron of WSJ.\nDoug Cameron : Okay. I've got a hugely loaded question for Devon and Derek and a super quick follow-up for Vasu if you'll let me. The loaded one. You must be relieved that you don't have to finance 100 planes this year given where interest rates are and the bigger of supplier delays. Just on that latter point, what sort of complication does the uncertainty of when you actually get planes as opposed to contractually gating them. What does that do to your ability and choices for aircraft finance options? \nDevon May : Well, you're right. I am happy that we're taking 23 airplanes and 12 of them are already financed this year. I will say we did go through a huge wave of investment prior to the pandemic. And over that period, I think that the timing is obviously fortunate we're in a nice economic environment, a really good environment for financing those airplanes. As we look out to this year, I don't think the timing of the deliveries as it sits today is too concerning with how we're going to finance the airplane -- more than anything, we just want to make sure the airplanes are delivered and in schedule so we can run a great operation and have really solid schedules for our customers. So what we've done on that front is we have planned conservatively within service base that we believe are coming in far later than when we'll actually take delivery of the airplane. And that's something that's going to be really great for customers.\nRobert Isom : Yes. And we continue to work with both Airbus and Boeing to make sure that we encourage them in an appropriate fashion to deliver on time. And I know that they're working hard to make sure that they can meet our needs.\nDoug Cameron : That's great. And just quickly for Vasu. Vasu, are you seeing any kind of scores on the fare and schedule or scheduling front, just given how competitive capacity trends are going? Or is demand just that strong that you aren't seeing anything anywhere?\nVasu Raja: Thanks for the question. We don't comment on fair and competitive scheduling trends. But I will say we are really encouraged with the demand trends that we see and are very confident in the airline we've set up to go and take care of our customers along the way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Arnold of Dallas Morning News.\nKyle Arnold: You've had some cuts at the regional level or service to some smaller cities. What's your strategy behind the regional served locations right now? And do you think there'll be further cuts as we continue to go through this pilot shortage at the regional level?\nRobert Isom : Hey, Kyle, I'll just start on this. Look, it's really unfortunate that we've had to reduce service anywhere most especially to some of the smaller communities. That's certainly a result of the issues that we faced with pilot staffing at our regional airlines. As I mentioned before, we're working really hard on it. American, I think, has taken the biggest step to get people into the industry of anyone, and I know others have followed us there. That's going to have an impact. We've seen the benefits of those efforts, and we're stabilizing the fleet, and I think that we just grow back from here. \nKyle Arnold: Is there any outlook on how long there might be constraints at that level?\nRobert Isom : Yes. So I think from a regional perspective, it takes time to get people back into the industry. But again, for anybody that is listening and reading, it's a great time to come into aviation. These are careers. Our pilot careers are ones that are -- can be great quality of life, and also very lucrative as well. And so I think it's an opportunity that as we look to the future, that there are communities that haven't typically been places where we sourced pilots that we're going to look to in the future, we're showing great progress in hiring pilots of color and also female pilots. And I look at that as an opportunity going forward that's going to greatly benefit and really change the face of our flight crews and really looking forward to it. I think it's something that's probably over the course of the next couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ted Reed of Forbes.\nTed Reed: My question is for Robert. Robert, we've been hearing you say for a long time that you're going to make a reliable airline and a profitable airline and you seem to have done that this year or last year. So now I want to know what is the vision for the future? Can American be restored being the greatest airline as it once we perceive? And do you have a path to do that now that you've started to accomplish your other goals?\nRobert Isom : Ted, great to hear from you. Let me just start with this. I'm really pleased with profitable quarters and producing a profit for the full year in 2022. The things that we've talked about doing are the right things. Getting customers to where they want to go, having the broadest network and doing it in a fashion that can produce profits, pay down debt is exactly where we need to go. And off of that platform, I see great things. But what you're going to see from us as certainly in the near term is more of the same, intense focus on reliability and profitability and accountability. And for our customers, that's going to mean we're going to deliver for them, deliver with the best network that Vasu has talked about, making sure that we have a travel rewards program that's best in the industry. We're going to operate with excellence, and it's going to require even greater planning and day-to-day execution. And when things don't go right, and let's face it. We're in a business where all sorts of things can happen. We got to be the best at recovering and you're going to see us continue to invest in that. And along the way, we have the opportunity to really make better use of technology to further digitalize our operations and our customer experience. And Ganesh Jayaram, who's our new CIO, has been charged with executing exactly that. and ultimately, put this all together in a business model that is incredibly efficient improves margins and reduces debt. That's what we're focused on right now. I want to keep the team and their head in the game every day. And really excited about what that means for the future because I do think it means that American is not just more competitive out in the marketplace, but we're going to be more competitive in terms of stock performance as well.\nTed Reed: Let me just ask a follow-up to that. When you look back at the history of the industry, the people who've been considered the greatest leaders have been the ones who have expanded the airline Wolf candle. And going forward, I don't mean right away, but over the years, can this airline expand maybe more in Asia or places where you're perceived this week?\nRobert Isom : Ted, just first off, just in terms of ego around here, look, we are focused on business and really making sure that we have the capacity to address the opportunities in the marketplace. American has been around for 96 years now. We're coming up on our 100th anniversary in 2026. And I want American to be the airlines that meet the needs of our customers, our communities and our shareholders as well. And so we're focused on that right now. And look, we're really encouraged by what we're seeing.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the media Q&A. I will now turn the call back over to Robert Isom for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom : Thanks for that. Thanks, everybody, for listening in. Look, American is in a position of strength, especially as we take a look at coming out of the pandemic. We're poised to recover. We're going to focus on our goals, reliability, profitability, making sure that we reduce our leverage and put American in a position to take advantage of opportunities that come about. We're really encouraged by the results and excited about the opportunities ahead. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And now I'd like to turn the call over to your moderator, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Scott Long. Please go ahead.\nScott Long: Thanks, Latif [ph]. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call this morning, we have our CEO, Robert Isom; and our Vice Chair and CFO, Derek Kerr. A number of our other senior executives are also on the call for the Q&A session. Robert will start the call this morning with an overview of the third quarter, and Derek will follow with details on the quarter and our operating plans and outlook going forward. After Derek's comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions followed by questions from the media. [Operator Instructions]. And before we begin today, we must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast of capacity and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. And the information we're giving you on this call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. This morning, American reported a third quarter GAAP net income of $483 million. And excluding net special items, a third quarter net income of $478 million. We produced revenues of $13.5 billion, which sets a new record for any quarter in the history of American Airlines. When I took on the CEO role in March, I told you American was going to do two things this year: run a reliable operation and return to profitability. The second is a bit longer than we would have liked to get where we want on the operations side, but we're pleased with how the airline is performing today, and we know we're on the right trajectory. As far as profitability, we've now delivered two profitable quarters in a row and we're forecasting a profitable fourth quarter with continued strength in demand. We could not have made either of those commitments or ensure we deliver that item if it weren't for the hard work of the American Airlines team. They do a phenomenal job every day taking care of our customers and each other. Their teamwork, resiliency, and determination allow us to continue our focus of running a reliable operation and sustaining profitability. We keep that focus because in our business, reliability is everything. It's the foundation of the service we provide our customers. A predictable solid operation changes the entire work experience of our team. Reliability also enables our long-term profitability and achieving sustained profitability is how we will meet our debt reduction targets and continue to invest in our team and deliver the network products and services our customers want. With that in mind, let's talk more about the third quarter specifically. Our record quarterly revenue of $13.5 billion is a 13% increase over 2019. Notably, we achieved this record revenue while flying nearly 10% less capacity than we did in the third quarter of 2019. And we're pleased to have exceeded our initial guidance on both revenue and pretax margin in the third quarter despite constraints still facing American and the rest of the industry. American's third quarter results, including our record revenue performance are significant, considering their macroeconomic uncertainty facing so many people. Demand remains strong, and it's clear that our customers in the U.S. and other parts of the world continue to value air travel and the ability to reconnect post pandemic. Importantly, many of the demand trends we saw emerge during the pandemic are becoming more consistent and shaping our commercial focus for 2023 and beyond. Leisure and business revenue remain incredibly strong, again, surpassing 2019 levels in the third quarter. Demand for small and medium-sized businesses and customers traveling for a combination of business and leisure continue to outpace the recovery of managed corporate travel. As that revenue continues to build, it will be additive to an already strong base of business demand, led by small and medium business and blended trips. That as well as the return of long-haul international travel leaves us very bullish about overall demand even in an uncertain economic environment. The changing nature demand provides an opportunity to rework our commercial offerings to better meet the needs of all customers and create a more resilient and profitable business. We continue to develop the most comprehensive airline network in the world. As we have shared on previous calls, over the past few years, we have made the decision to greatly simplify our fleet and network focusing on our flying on where we can create outsized customer value and working with our partners to create choices and value in areas where it's cost prohibitive to do so ourselves. This means prioritizing the flying that can best generate a return today, not bringing back flying it was only marginally profitable before the pandemic or that we had hoped it would one day generate a return. It also means using our partners to fill in the gaps and deliver a seamless network to our customers. That work continues, particularly with our Northeast alliance with JetBlue, our West Coast international alliance with Alaska and our Atlantic and Pacific joint businesses. To better match our product offering to customers and network, we recently announced enhancements to our long-haul fleet that will give American an unrivaled premium experience among U.S. carriers. Starting in 2024, customers will see new flagship suite seats on our Boeing 777-300ER aircraft as well as on our new Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321XLR deliveries. With these new interiors, premium seating on our long-haul aircraft will grow by more than 45% by 2026. We're working to give our customers better choices and more access to the world's largest and best travel rewards program, and that's AAdvantage. It's clear that customers want more when they shop for travel, more choices to ways to earn and use miles and more incentives to earn miles even when they don't travel. So turning to our operations. As I mentioned at the outset, operating reliably is critical to everything we do. We have the youngest fleet and the best network and partners in the industry, but we can't take full advantage of those assets if we aren't running reliably. That's why we continue to invest in our operation with additional resources and new technology, and those efforts are paying off. Despite a challenging operating environment with hurricanes in Florida and Caribbean, and flooding in Dallas Fort Worth region, we restored our operating reliability to pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. And we did it while flying a schedule that was 25% larger than our closest competitor. We have delivered record on-time arrival rate and completion factor so far in October and expect to carry that momentum through the upcoming holiday season and beyond. Hurricane Fiona and Ian were devastating for so many, including the communities we serve in the places our team and customers call home. The American Airlines team stepped up in amazing ways to take care of our customers and each other during the very challenging circumstances. Through our AAdvantage program and the partnership with the Red Cross, almost $4 million has been raised to support victims of the storms, and American continues to support our team through the American Airlines Family Fund. The storms moved through quickly, but they had an outsized impact on American given the size of our operation in Florida. We had to cancel more than 1,500 flights the last four days of September, given the impact of Hurricane Ian. And we estimate right now that these storms reduced revenue by about $40 million. As we close out the year and look to the first quarter, we continue to size the airline for the resources we have available and the operating conditions we face. This approach and our strong operational performance in the September and so far in October give us a lot of confidence as we head into the busy travel holiday season. In closing, we remain very encouraged by the continued strength in demand and the trends we're seeing across the business. American has the best team and most efficient assets in the industry, and we have built an airline that can be successful in many different demand and economic environments. Looking ahead, we're focused on investing in our operations, our network, and our partnerships to ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers. And of course, we'll do so while remaining focused on achieving sustained profitability and reducing our debt. And with that, I'll hand it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the American Airlines team for their efforts during the third quarter. Our airline success during the quarter was only possible because of the hard work of our team during a challenging summer. This morning, we reported a third quarter GAAP net income of $483 million, excluding net special items, we reported a net income of $478 million, both equate to earnings of $0.69 per diluted share. Since the beginning of the year, we have been focused on returning the airline to sustained profitability. We are pleased that our third quarter results build on that progress we made in the second quarter. We beat the high end of our initial earnings expectations due to the continuation of the strong demand environment. The third quarter was our highest quarterly revenue in company history, beating the second quarter of this year. The domestic and short-haul international entities continue to lead the revenue recovery, and we expect further improvement in long-haul international as we continue to grow back our capacity. The investments we have made to renew and simplify our fleet position us well for the future. We continue to operate the youngest, most fuel-efficient fleet among U.S. network carriers. In August, we began taking deliveries of new 788 aircraft from Boeing for the first time in 15 months. In the third quarter, we took delivery of four 788, and we expect to receive five the remainder of this year and four in the first half of 2023. Our Boeing 789s are still expected to be delivered starting in 2024. During the quarter, we also took delivery of three A321neos and reactivated six 7378 from long-term storage. In the fourth quarter, we now expect to take delivery of eight A320neos, three E175, in addition to the 5788 I mentioned previously. Based on our latest guidance from Boeing, we now expect to take delivery of 19 737 MAX 8 in 2023 compared to the 27 deliveries that we were previously expected. This change in timing will shift planned CapEx out of 2023 into future years. Our 2023 aircraft CapEx net of leases is now expected to be $1.6 billion. We ended the third quarter with $14.3 billion of total available liquidity, which is $700 million higher than our initial third quarter forecast due to continued forward booking strength seen throughout the quarter. This level of liquidity is more than double the amount we had at the year-end of 2019. Reducing total debt continues to be a top priority, and we remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025. As of the end of the third quarter, we have reduced total debt by $5.6 billion versus the 2021 peak. And as I mentioned last quarter, we expect further benefit from a reduction in our pension liability that will make -- reflected at the end of the year. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make approximately $540 million of scheduled debt and finance lease payments freeing up additional collateral in the process. We maintained our elevated liquidity position throughout the third quarter and continue to balance appropriate target liquidity levels with the expected recovery, debt reduction opportunities and investment in the business. We'll continue to target $10 billion to $12 billion in total liquidity in the medium term and intend to utilize excess liquidity above that level to accelerate our deleveraging initiative at the appropriate time. Looking forward, our next term loan maturity is our $1.2 billion term loan, which does not mature until December of 2023. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect to produce an operating margin of between 7.5% -- 5.5% and 7.5% based on the current demand and fuel price forecast. We currently expect to produce total revenues that are 11% to 13% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 on capacity that is 5% to 7% lower than 2019 levels. This continued strength in demand is expected to result in total revenue per available seat mile that is 18% to 20% higher than 2019. Our fourth quarter CASM, excluding fuel and net special items, is expected to be up between 8% and 10% compared to 2019. These higher unit costs versus 2019 are primarily driven by inflationary pressure and lower relative asset utilization. Our current forecast for the fourth quarter assumes fuel between $3.51 and $3.56, which is approximately 70% higher than 2019 levels. Finally, while we are still in the process of building our 2023 operating plans, I'd like to share a few thoughts on our approach. We continue to believe that 2023 demand for air travel will be robust. We currently see no signs of demand slowing as we move into the new year. But as always, we will continue to keep a close eye on the macroeconomic environment and will adjust this plans, if necessary. Importantly, we will continue to size the airline for the resources we have with a focus on reliability and profitability. As we move into 2023, the constraints facing our business today will remain. Those constraints are slower than planned aircraft deliveries and lower utilization of our fleet largely driven by regional pilot constraints. Therefore, based on our preliminary plans, we expect our 2023 capacity will be between 95% and 100% of 2019 levels. We believe this approach to capacity will produce strong profitability and free cash flow, reliable operating performance and allow appropriate levels of flexibility in this very fluid environment. In conclusion, demand for our product is strong and we remain nimble in our planning and execution to ensure we optimize for the environment we're operating in. As we close out 2022 and move into 2023, we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our stated objectives of operational reliability and sustained profitability because of our world-class network, efficient fleet and incredible team. With that, I will open up the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Thanks for the time. I was wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit about how the fleet changes you guys have made through the pandemic are sort of impacting operational performance. Obviously, it's going to have an impact on reliability. But also when you think about sort of scheduling the network, maybe getting better utilization, maybe taking some peaks out of the schedule being unconstrained by the directionality of some of the equipment constraints that are in there. Can you just talk a little bit about how that -- those fleet changes have impacted overall productivity and the early signs there?\nRobert Isom: Hey David, thanks for the question, too. And we're really proud of what we were able to do over the pandemic. A bunch of different projects went into place. You know the story about rationalizing the fleet, getting down really from a mainline perspective, down to two types of narrow bodies and two types of wide bodies. We did the same thing in our regional fleet as well. But during the pandemic as well, we accelerated our Cabin Consistency project, that Oasis project where we were able to upsize the 737 and then also make sure that our A320 family were consistent in terms of seating as well. All that work is done. So it's freed up a tremendous amount of resources. But then just in terms of operating, think about everything from not having to carry as many park pools in inventory. Think about pilot training and what's required from going from an FO on one equipment type to another and the simulators that are required for that, the training that's required for that. So look, as we get back to full utilization of our resources that's going to be something that I think pays dividends. You'll start to see it as we get back really to full utilization. And I think that that's something that plays well long into the future. We see it already. I know it's producing better reliability. It's easier for our team. And from a revenue perspective, I'll hand it off to Vasu. I can tell you, it's making his job easier.\nVasu Raja: Yes. I'll pick up right there, David. I think it's a great question. As we went through the pandemic, a major principle in how we've been planning the airline is to build it in a way where it is as nimble and responsive to demand and is as resilient in the face of crisis. And as you look at that over time, really the wide-body fleet for American Airlines was a strange kind of liability because that's the most volatile part of our business. It's part of our business that our customers have just valued a lot less than our short-haul network. And so for us, as you look out there, we took jets out. And so look at the fourth quarter schedule, we are 15% smaller long-haul airline. But very importantly, what we've also done right is when we have such a big fleet of narrow bodies, we have a lot more flexibility in how we send them. So we've changed our capacity mix pretty materially from pre-pandemic. As we were entering the fourth quarter in 2019, we were about a 70-30 short-haul, long-haul airline. As we enter the fourth quarter now, we're something a lot closer to an 80-20 short-haul, long-haul airline. And that airline that we have is something which is a lot more dynamic. There's fewer fleet types like Robert said, if demand changes, we're much more able to adjust. And quite frankly, the short-haul business is and has been for the last 20 years, a much more durable part of it. And frankly, you see it right now. Right now, long-haul is doing well. At some point in time, it will come down, but short haul remains pretty consistently strong across the business cycle.\nDavid Vernon: And as you think about that plan to get back to 95% to 100% next year, is that going to get you the full benefit of utilizing the new fleet? Or are we still going to be carrying some additional sort of productivity headwinds from training or resourcing or just underutilization from an hours per aircraft per day kind of thing?\nRobert Isom: David, I'll start. Derek can chime in here, too. It's a good question, but we look at it as upside for the airline. We know that we can find more out of the assets that we have. There are constraints out there, notably pilot constraints, both for the regional side and just the massive amount of training that we have to do on the mainline side. Those constraints are going to be out there. Over time, they'll break free. But we're confident that we can actually get more utilization out of the current fleet to actually get us beyond flying at 100% of 2019 levels. And that's where I think the cost story as the airline gets really interesting. But it's going to take a little bit of time to get to that point.\nDavid Vernon: All right, thanks a lot for your time guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is open, Savi Syth.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good morning everyone. Could you please talk about a little bit more on the hiring and kind of training side on the mainline, where you are on that and kind of expectations as you head into 2023?\nRobert Isom: Sure, Savi. I appreciate the question. Look, we're hiring more pilots this year than we ever have in our history in a given year. So we're looking at hiring almost 2,000 pilots. We're on track to actually accomplish that from a Mainline perspective. So I feel really great about that. But let's face it. Training that many pilots is something we've never done before coming out of the pandemic. We've had to make sure that resources are all in the right spot whether that's additional simulators, resources like that or even things like instructors. So that's all working its way through, and we feel very confident that over time, that our pilot pipeline for the Mainline is very strong and our training resources are absolutely going to match the needs that we have going forward. The regional side of the business is a little bit different. We didn't hire and let's face it, well, we didn't hire for two years during the pandemic at all. And then not only that, people didn't come into the business. And so we've got to work our way through that. And you got a supply issue that I think is coming back online. I feel really confident about it. We're facilitating that through things like our cadet program and creating financing vehicles for people that want to get into the business. That's all going well. But then the other issue is what's your run short, you actually have issues of getting kind of pilots from the right seat to the left seat and there are hours requirements that have to -- that you have to fulfill. We're working our way through that. That's going to take a little bit longer in my opinion. That's maybe two, three years to work out versus the Mainline side, which I think is something from a training perspective, we really get fully caught up over the course of the next year.\nSavanthi Syth: That's helpful. If I might, just a following up on that. So I appreciate the kind of the thoughts on where capacity could be next year. Any way you could help us think about the cost side of things and how much of the headwinds that you're seeing today, we might see kind of go away as you kind of get through next year?\nDerek Kerr: Well, Savi, I mean we're still going through our planning process. So we gave the guide for the ASMs, but we're not ready to guide costs yet. We will in the January call. We're working through our budget. We're in that today. So that -- the CASM will depend on what we fly, but we will go through that on the January call.\nSavanthi Syth: Understood, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Jamie Baker, your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Good morning everybody. Two quick questions for Derek and then a follow-up for Vasu. Derek, why the pivot from pretax to operating margin guidance? And second, what's the increase in interest expense year-on-year at the current forward curve for your floating rate debt?\nDerek Kerr: Okay. Just no reason for the pivot. I mean we're just -- could be inconsistent with the rest of the airlines from an operating perspective. That's what we're focusing on. And then on the interest rate, I mean, our cost of debt has gone probably from about 4% to 5% and our fixed floating is 70-30. So as we look into next year, our interest expense is -- this quarter was around $494 million. So that go up in the fourth quarter to about $530 million. So it's probably about $40 million from the third to fourth quarter on an interest expense basis. But that's totally offset right now with the cash levels we have on interest income. So it was offset in the third quarter interest income depends on where cash is in the fourth quarter. And you can see that our guide for non-op is pretty even quarter-over-quarter.\nJamie Baker: Yes, okay. That's why -- I have to appreciate that. So Vasu, as I continue to think through how American needs to adapt to new travel patterns. And look, maybe you don't aside from just shifting some capacity to certain days of the week, maybe Thanksgiving return peak shifts a bit. But I keep thinking there's more that can be done fare fences, promotions, AAdvantage. Just to better capture these new travel patterns out there or is it just as simple as adjusting the dayality of schedules? Not sure if dayality is an American term, but I trust you know what I mean.\nVasu Raja: I think you just made a term, Jamie. That's fine. Keep going.\nJamie Baker: Well, we use it at Air Mike. So -- but that was a long time ago. Just really wondering if there's more than just pure scheduling nuances to best monetizing all these new travel patterns that are emerging, certainly much to my personal post-COVID surprise?\nVasu Raja: Yes, that's a great question, Jamie. And let me start with just some context setting for just how indeed the world has changed. First of all, we are in general, really encouraged by what is happening with aggregate demand. As we say, the demand for travel and for air travel, in particular has never been higher and remains strong in the kind of all future periods. But the shape of that, the composition has changed a lot. Now we're in a place for the quarter where 45% of our revenue came from blended trips, about 30% from discretionary or what we historically called leisure trip. And the remaining 25% from nondiscretionary that we've historically called business trips. Importantly, within business, about 17 to 20 points of that is coming actually from noncontracted unmanaged businesses. The remaining kind of five to eight points are from contracted corporations. That's meaningfully small, call it, four, five points smaller than historic. And that is the thing that is actually really encouraging for us for a couple of reasons that, that big category of blended demand, which is growing. First and foremost, that unmanaged business is coming in at yield values where their gross yields are similar to the corporate contracted transactions that are not there. But very importantly, they're net yields, not of their cost of sale is actually very often higher than what we spilled off. But two, and kind of more directly related to your question, what we find is that that indeed, this blended demand uses our airline network in a very economical way. Almost half of that demand is using O&D markets in our system where American's network is uniquely advantaged. But additionally, we've seen across our system, not just for blended demand, two points of traffic shift from what we'll call the peak business periods in the day. That's pre 0800 and post 1600 and into the body of the day, the 800 to 1600 window. So if you think about that, historically, we've done a lot to kind of peak our schedules for the ends of the day, but now we're seeing a lot of really high-yielding demand in the places where it's most economical to frankly go and run the airline. And that takes me to the third point, which is where you're starting to go. But as you -- as we start to contract, and we've done a lot of this, where we -- when you don't look at the transaction, look at the customer behind it, what we're finding is that a customer who has a blended trip in their profile is twice as likely to go and enroll in the Advantage program. They are 3x more likely to sign up for one of our co-branded credit cards, they don't already have it. Those who have a credit card spend 40% more than a typical business customer. And these customers are overwhelmingly going to aa.com because it's frankly the only place where you can go and price and shop for a blended trip. So that is very much influencing how we're thinking in a couple of meaningful ways, as you say, that first and foremost, the value that we can deliver to these customers through our loyalty program, and as we call them our currency partnerships with people such as Citi are paramount importance to our customers, and therefore to us. And then there's a lot about the selling and distribution model that the airlines have operated on certainly that we've operated under that warrant some change that we can go in certain customer demand.\nJamie Baker: That's super helpful. My risk is acing the right thing down at both the type and I hadn't thought about the loyalty angle. So thank you very much for that. I appreciate it.\nVasu Raja: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you. And my compliments on that pronunciation, better than many earnings calls. On the $95 million to $100 million for next year, I wanted to ask you how that might compare to a theoretical upper limit. How much of this is conservatism just given fuel and kind of macro uncertainty versus just your modeling of the staffing constraints. So if you really wanted to step on the gas, if the environment warranted, how much higher could you push than that 100%?\nRobert Isom: Hey, Duane, thanks for the question. Look, for us right now, we're going to size the airline for the resources that we have and the demand environment that we face. There's a lot of variability in just about everything that we deal with right now. But the thing that I think that Vasu will tell you, Derek and our finance team will tell you, the best thing we could do is make sure that we have a predictable, stable airline, something that we can point to in the future. That's what we're trying to do, given all the constraints that we face right now. So from the perspective of what is a limiting factor, we probably try to fly a little bit more. What, we've got pilot constraints that are going to take a while to work their way through. Notably, we talked about what's happening on the regional side of things. So in terms of an upper bound, I don't have a number there. I can -- I don't know if we've actually gone out and calculated the max level.\nDerek Kerr: No, no. I think, Duane, as we talked about on the last call, we do have some unsupportable aircraft at this point in time. As things change on the regional side, it's all dependent on pilot hiring and how much the main line hired from the regionals. And so we're just -- we're trying to be prudent in what we do as we saw in the summer, making some of those kind of assumptions was not easy. So I think we're being prudent on it. If there is more capability for us to fly from a regional perspective and a mainline perspective, because those constraints come down, then we'll be able to -- we could fly more with the fleet that we have, put it that way. So is that a couple of percent probably. If we flew the whole thing, we could get somewhere in the 5% to 10% range from the fleet that we have. But I think those constraints are going to be there. As Robert said, the regional constraints are going to be there for a longer period of time. We're working through them, and hopefully, there's other options that we have to bring that flying back up.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful perspective. And then just for a quick follow-up on ops. Can you quantify the savings or the assumed savings from running a better operation in your 4Q guide? And it's an American question, frankly, it's an industry question. What have we learned or institutionalized from this summer that gives you confidence that sort of these ops -- better ops will sustain. Maybe in fourth quarter, frankly, it's just -- it's less peak. It's fewer ASMs, maybe that's the driver and the confidence. But if you can help us understand what's been institutionalized from this summer. That would be helpful.\nRobert Isom: Yes. Duane, that's something we talk a lot about. And look, we talk about utilization and getting more out of it, but there's always an offset to that utilization with running an airline that is potentially less reliable. So what we've done right now is we've taken a look at and given that the pandemic brought so much variability in just about every input to the business, okay? Everything from partners, at airports to aerospace limitations to Boeing and Airbus, delivering aircraft, our pilots and flight attendants. What we're trying to do is build in at least a little buffer in a number of areas right now. And that is absolutely something that we're carrying on into the fourth quarter. Where does it show up? It shows up in higher reserve levels for pilots and flight attendants. Or does it show up? It shows up in terms of maybe not running even some of the aircraft that we have is hardest -- hard as you would. It shows up in terms of making sure that we're trying to take into account restrictions that we have in the airports and with aerospace as well. So we're putting that all in. My hope is that as the airline gets up to speed and our other partners and vendors get up to speed, but that's something that we can slowly take a look at. But to the point that you brought up, this airline, American Airlines, the industry as a whole, we need to get back to reliability levels that we have pre pandemic and even higher. That's the focus, and you're going to see some fest in that, whether it's through putting in degrees of safety factor and things or just making sure that we fly the airline appropriate for demand and operating conditions.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, Michael Linenberg.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes, good morning everyone. I want to kind of touch on this as sort of a follow-on on Jamie's question about sort of structural change here. And I don't know if it's to Robert or Vasu. Robert, you talked about 45% more premium seating in your fleet. And when I look at some of the numbers, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like you're like seven 879, the premium seats are going to go up by 60%. And then when I look at where you will be on an absolute basis post this new product rollout, you'll be pretty well ahead of United and Delta. And I'm just -- it feels like it's a bit of a bet and it is maybe more of a secular shift to have that much premium seating. And I'm just -- I'm thinking what is the potential downside risk, sort of how you think about that? And it also looks like, I guess, we're going to see the retirement of the first class on the 777s. Is that right?\nRobert Isom: Yes. I'll now let Vasu, go ahead and start this one.\nVasu Raja: Yes. Thanks Mike, for the question. It's a very good one. I'll answer your second one first. Yes, the first class will not exist on the 777 or for that matter, at American Airlines for the simple reason that our customers aren't buying it. The quality of the business class C has improved so much. And frankly, by removing it, we can go provide more business class seats, which is what our customers most want or most willing to pay for. But look, a really important thing to your first question, starts actually with the structure of the network that's here now versus what was their pre-pandemic. And though we've talked about it on a lot of calls, it probably can't be emphasized enough. And it's something which you can see through all the successive schedules -- on the quarterly schedules through COVID and even into what we published through the rest of this year and early next. But again, remember for us, we're running a long-haul business now that is 15% smaller than what existed pre-COVID. And so -- and furthermore, of that, about 70-ish percent of our -- presume we're an 80-20 short-haul, long-haul split. But for us, very importantly, 70% of our capacity almost 70% is in our core hubs. What's not there is really in some really strong international markets that are very premium-heavy. Heathrow long-haul South America, eventually Tokyo, places like that or else in really long-haul markets where, frankly, through the strength of our partnerships, we're able to go and make a larger premium cabin work. So because of that, we -- the airline has actually arced itself to a place where there's a lot more demand for its premium seats. The last thing I'll say and this actually picks up right where my answer to Jamie left off, too. And what we're really encouraged by right now is actually long-haul profitability for American Airlines is better than what has historically been in pre-2019 on a margin basis, in some cases, on an absolute basis. What it's being driven by is not just the premium cabin. But interestingly, it's being driven by blended customer demand there. I mean it used to be that large contract in corporations were as much as 50% of what filled those seats. Now between 40% and 50% of it is blended demand, and the rest of it is actually leisure demand that is willing to go and pay more for the quality of the business class seat. All of that is coming at a higher net yield values than what was there before. So we're really encouraged about what the future holds. And that's a lot of the context behind some of these bets we're making with the long-haul configuration.\nMichael Linenberg: Very helpful, Vasu. If I can just sneak in one other one. And just on the regional side. You guys seem to be doubling down on adding more regional service, including 50 seaters. And I know in the past, you've talked about how that historically has been -- those markets have been fairly high yield. But how does that square with just the rising costs that we're seeing on regional labor, other input costs for the regionals? And is maybe the offset that you have this sort of unique from a network perspective, you among all the carriers may be the only game in town in so many of these markets that you're still able to make it up in revenue. How do you square that? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Vasu, let me start and then you jump in. Well, first off, look, just in terms of the 50 seaters that we have, we've reduced the number of 50-seaters that we've had in place over time. I don't have the exact number hand. But what we have is a network that's ideally suited for servicing a number of regional markets. And you know what, 50 seaters is going to have in place in our system. But right now, the big focus is getting the aircraft that we have back up in the air. There's not a doubling count it say, hey, this made sense before. It makes a lot of sense now. Especially given what we're seeing with the rest of the marketplace. Vasu, go ahead.\nVasu Raja: Yes, that's right. I'll just add a couple of doses of back to that too that what we -- especially that I was really encouraged by is when we crossed over from the summer in the September, which is historically a weaker demand time for the airlines. What we found is that historically, in, let's call it, September of 2019, only about 20% to 25% of our revenue was coming from places where our O&D markets where our network was advantaged. When we got into September of this year, it was somewhere between 30% to 33% coming from places where our network was advantaged. And indeed, we see this over and over again, that we make 30% more O&Ds than our competitors, 30% more O&Ds and markets that where we consider them to be advantaged. And by that, I mean either [Technical Difficulty] O&Ds, we're the only ones who serve it or we serve it with the most convenient schedule. And so for us, there's a -- we see that very much. I mean, the way our network is just structurally built. We are the very best at serving all of the small cities of the Western Hemisphere and connecting customers there to the global marketplace. Others are a whole lot better at flying long-haul to Asia, or whatever the case might be. But for that reason, there are some really unique things to American Airlines, where we have a lot of value in a range of equipment types from the smallest 50-seat or 75-seat RJs to a 200-seat narrow-body, whereas for a lot of others, a lot more of their value may be and having multiple flavors of a 300-seat wide line.\nRobert Isom: Mike -- go ahead Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Mike, the only thing I was going to add is we have three wholly owns, Piedmont is going to fly 50-50 seaters.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes.\nDerek Kerr: That's what they have today. We're growing those back for sure. Boeing is getting out of the 50 seaters over time, we'll fly some next year. They're going to move. But I know you're referring probably to the Air Wisconsin transaction.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes.\nDerek Kerr: In a market where there's difficulty in pilot supply, Air Wisconsin has a great network. We've worked with them before. They have a very good pilot supply and comply out of Chicago. And so I think it's an opportunistic transaction to do that in an environment where there's a pilot constraint on the regional side.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Thanks for the explanation everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Your line is open, Conor Cunningham.\nConor Cunningham: Hey everyone. Thanks for the time. Just on Savi's question from a hiring standpoint. I don't think you actually gave a number on 2023. Is there a stated goal from a pilot standpoint. The only reason why I asked as your headcount, I think is down 2%, you're talking about capacity being flat to down 5%. So basically, you're there from a hiring from an employee standpoint. So I'm just trying to figure out what we're talking about until into next year?\nRobert Isom: Derek, go ahead.\nDerek Kerr: Yes, I think, Conor, we're going to have the schoolhouse pull all next year. So my assumption is if we hired 2,000 this year, we'll be hiring the same amount next year as we bring back the mainline fleet. So I would expect the schoolhouse to be full and us to train as about as many pilots in 2023 as we are in 2022.\nRobert Isom: And Conor, I'd just add that some of that as well. We still have considerable retirements due to age 65. We're at the peak levels. So while we're hiring 2,000, it doesn't mean that there's a net incremental of 2,000 pilots by any means.\nDerek Kerr: Yes, I think we retired somewhere in the neighborhood of 700, 750 pilots next year. So a lot of that's retirement.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you. And then the progress being made on profitability is obviously great to see. But I think the question a lot of folks have is just around profitability with new labor deals. I'm not trying to get you guys to cost me that publicly, but just how do you think about profitability into '23? Is it just more of like the demand picture is just so much better that we can absorb a lot of the pilot pay increases or labor deals and all that stuff. Just any high-level thoughts that you may have, that would be great. Thanks.\nRobert Isom: Well, I'll start like certainly, anything that we do with our pilots or flight attendants or any of the other team members that we're currently negotiating with, we do -- we negotiate with a mind to making sure, we take care of our team that we take care of the company as well. When we think about the deals that we have, we're going to make sure that they fit with an economic perspective of making money. And I'm confident we can do that. And it's the best interest of our pilots and flight attendants and mechanics and everybody in this company. So there's win-win deals that will be had out there. I'm confident that we can do it. And it's in an environment where, yes -- we take a look at travel coming back, being something that just in terms of where people want to spend money is a change from prior to the pandemic. We take a look at the amount of growth that the general economy has had and yet the airline business is still -- American Airlines is 10% smaller. And then on top of that, we know that travel is a bargain still, general inflation is running about 5% and ticket prices are up since 2019, about 3% -- or less than 3% on an annual basis. So I look at all that and think that the kind of momentum that we have experienced in the third and fourth quarter carry in. And certainly, they're offsetting costs that are built in, in terms of redundancies that we have in place. But as we get the fleet back up and as Derek mentioned a little bit earlier, it may take us a while to get the regionals back up and maybe through 2023 to get the mainline fully back up as well. But we will have efficiencies that come with upgauging that we did -- we've done and will come with the incremental utilization that we can get out of our aircraft -- and quite frankly, some of the things that Vasu's talked about in terms of network, in terms of marketing and then also in terms of engaging our customers in a way that they will pay us for things like credit cards. The relationship is deepening. So on all those fronts, I feel really confident that we can put together an airline that can cover increased labor expenses and still make margins that that we think are appropriate positive for the airline.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is open, Helane Becker.\nRobert Isom: Helane?\nOperator: Hi, Helane. Your line should be open now. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thank you. Can you hear me now?\nRobert Isom: Yes. We can hear you now.\nHelane Becker: Okay, good. I'm not sure exactly what happened there because I was not on mute. So one question for clarification. What's the paid load factor in business versus upgrades in business class?\nVasu Raja: Hey Helane, this is Vasu. Look, off the top of my head, I don't know well enough to go and tell you, but I will say this that our payloads in business are growing as a percentage of what they've been historically, but it changed a lot between July and September, as being shifted over. But a major part for that is simply changes that we've made with our upgrade program that we used to have a lot of different, what I'll call cottage upgrade concepts that could be had through different certificates through our loyalty program, do things like that. We've been trying to go and simplify that for our customers, digitize a whole lot more of it and frankly, offer more fair products to customers. So we're now getting to a place where it's probably our lowest of time as little as 60% could have been paid. Now we're in a place where, indeed, like in the domestic system, something closer to 80% or so.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then if I could follow-up a question on the aircraft deliveries and the schedule. So Derek, you talked about the under on the number of aircraft you actually have on for delivery schedule for next year. So how are you scheduling the airline? Are you assuming, I suppose a lower level of deliveries? Or are you -- could you just walk me through how you plan the network, not knowing how many aircraft you're actually going to have available to fly.\nDerek Kerr: Yes. I think as we look into 2023, we didn't have a lot of deliveries anyway. We probably had 32 deliveries. What we've done is we know the four 788s are coming in. We know what those dates are, so we can plan that. And Neos coming -- the one Neo coming in, we know that. The MAXs, we've worked with Boeing to put our level of ops together. We were supposed to get 27 aircrafts. We've now taken that down to 19, and we have the delivery schedule that we believe that Boeing will meet. They need to meet those dates for us to hit the level of apps, but that's the way we're planning it. The good news for us is that we don't have a lot of deliveries next year. Our CapEx is way down. We know what our fleet is. The uncertainty for us from a level of operations perspective is probably more on the regional side. And what we're doing is being conservative on the regional side to plan three months out. We'll put a level of ops together for the full-year of what we -- where we think we are. And if the constraints fall-off, we have more ability to fly. We'll add those back into the schedule as we move throughout the year. But we'll plan at the level that we gave you, which is the 95 to 100. That assumes the push in the MAXs to only 19 aircraft and that they come in a little bit later. And we'll plan to schedule that way. We do have capabilities of putting the schedule out, and we can change it every three months and things like that. So you may see an adjustment to our plans as we go forward. but we were sticking the stake in the ground with this level, with this aircraft, a lot easier to do this year than it has in the past, not knowing when the 78s are coming, but still just the murkiest part for us is really the regional side and making sure that we can do the regionals at the levels we have them today.\nVasu Raja: I'll just add to something that Derek said there, really consistent with our principle of just making the airline as nimble and resilient as possible. One of the things that -- and a huge credit to [indiscernible] and Ronnie and many people in our network and operations team. But we figured out ways where effectively, instead of building to a fictitious delivery plan, we can build what we know and add, what as we call them lines of flying and on top of it, whether that is for regional jets for mainlines. And indeed if you go out and look at schedules at a time when so many airlines cut capacity closed in probably at least the only one that I've seen in published schedules being able to add capacity back as American Airlines. And so we're finding more ways to do it. It's doing that puts us in a much better place to go manage the airline operationally and financially. It makes it a little bit harder to go and manage things like the peak days after Thanksgiving, but it's a much more practical way to go manage through some of these infrastructure uncertainties that we've got.\nHelane Becker: That's hugely helpful. Thank you very much.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent of Citi. Your line is open, Stephen Trent.\nStephen Trent: Good morning everybody and thanks very much for squeezing me in. Most of my questions have been answered. I just had one quick question about fleet. I know you guys have gone through all of that operational dislocation with the MAX grounded in 2019. And as you think about longer term, any high-level view sort of what's optimal for American Airlines with respect to owning versus leasing versus sale leaseback, an ideal mix when you consider what's happening with interest rates and aircraft residual values, we just love to hear some color on that. Thank you.\nDerek Kerr: Yes, Stephen, I mean, the one thing I will say is we are very happy that we did our fleet replacement program at a time where we could finance aircraft at 3% level. So our -- as we look back at what we've done and where others have to go in this 6% to 7% range, we're very happy where we're at with the financing of our aircraft. As we look forward, we don't have many aircraft in 2023. So that's good news. We only have about 32 aircraft. We already have five of them financed. We look at all markets. We look at the WTC market, the sale-leaseback market, the mortgage market, and we are getting attractive pricing in those markets today. So our focus will be on the back half of 2023 and to finance those aircrafts. We're all good through 2022. We're all good through the first half of 2023 with very attractive financing. And hopefully, as we go forward, we don't have a significant amount of aircraft. We have 24 next year, and then we go into 50 and 50 to two years after that. So we've done our fleet replacement program under really, really good rates that are going to be with us for a long time. So we're very happy where we're positioned now from an aircraft financing perspective.\nStephen Trent: That's super helpful. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu, your line is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe if we could talk about just revenue trends to start. Q3 was the first quarter where international passenger revenue outperformed domestic. Any color on how you could -- how you think about that trend going forward and potentially the impact on the U.S. dollar strength?\nRobert Isom: Vasu, go ahead and start, and I want to add something at the end, too, okay?\nVasu Raja: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Well, look, we -- as mentioned before, the long-haul business is -- if you look back at over any time period you want, it's a much more volatile line of business to be than the short-haul business. We think that's absolutely the case. That said, we're really encouraged where things are right now. There is clearly demand that's out there for the long-haul product. That too is taking shape in a very different way than what was there before the pandemic but coming in at levels that are far greater than what was there before the pandemic. What's less known is that we're still in a place where so many markets are still opening up. As a practical matter, Japan really only opened up last week. So there's some major parts of the international systems that are coming back yet. They're still any number of inefficiencies there, which I know Robert can talk to a lot more that are going to yet be a bit of a drag. But over the long run, we're really excited for it, so much so that even though I've said that the airline is going to be an 80-20 short-haul, long-haul carrier. Nonetheless, we're taking 787s. We still have an order for XLRs and things like that out there because we do think that the long-haul business will come back and come back in a way, which can be really beneficial certainly to us and our customers.\nRobert Isom: Yes, there's things that we're doing as a country that are actually hindering the recovery of demand internationally. It could be stronger, a lot stronger. And I want to make sure that people are aware of that. Right now -- in the past, in 2019, 43% of international visitation into the U.S. that came from countries where you had to have a Visa to come into the United States. And back then in 2019, for people that wanted to come in for a first-time Visa to attend a big event meeting or kind of a convention. You maybe had to go and spend a few weeks to get a Visa. So you can actually buy a ticket with some reasonable assurance that you'd actually be able to travel. Well, now that process of getting a Visa is -- can be over a year, well over a year and really important big travel markets like countries like Brazil and Mexico and India. And when I talk about that 43% of inbound travel of international visitation, it's not like they're just -- it's not like we're limiting ourselves just on airfares and ticket prices and airline revenue, those people spent $120 billion when they came into the United States. So the country as a whole is hard. Here's what we're trying to do about it, because we need to get at this. You just -- the international recovery would be so much stronger if we got this out of the way. We're working with the state department. We've got to make sure that we respond to the situation to do so quickly. And it really comes in to making sure that B1 and B2 applicants, why come the United States participating in meetings that they're eligible to do so instead of taking their travel someplace else, which is what they're doing right now. So anyway, I just want to make that point, Vasu, that international travel could be stronger.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: No, that's great color, guys. And maybe just one follow-up for Vasu and his comments earlier on the loyalty program and credit card spend. How are you thinking about the loyalty program? Has there been a change in how American is viewing it and it's important to the operation relative to 2019?\nVasu Raja: Short answer, yes. Absolutely. We've seen it in any number of ways that -- look, so much of the marketplace has changed. Maybe the simplest way to think of it is this, those customers who are blending travel value travel, whereas for a lot of our customers prior to the pandemic, they might have traveled because their employer made them or they had to go and do it. So we're seeing people travel with a lot more intentionality. And when that happens, those same customers are much more willing to go and earn miles so that they can go and take their family on vacation, for example. So that's where we see like AAdvantage enrollments are growing record levels everywhere. As our partnerships expand, we're seeing growth in places like the West Coast and the Northeast. Levels that we've never seen before. But importantly, people are doing things like spending on their credit card. We did something where we counted credit card spending towards status, and that's been something really, really well received by our customers, too. So -- and the last thing I'll say to this is we just see a lot of upside here. If you compare our print out there in the sort of traditional network business, we're in a place where domestically in Latin America, we can be 10% to 20% larger than our competitors and produce unit revenues that are 5% to 10% larger than what they are. And that's a really good place to be in. But even still, compared to one of our largest network competitors, we -- they run 90% the airline that we do, but they produce a $1 billion more to their co-brand credit card program. So we're really focused on that, because we think it's a huge value driver for our customers, a very obvious one for us. We're really encouraged by the progress we've made with our partner in Citi. But as we look forward, we see that as a really key place where we need to have a strategic partnership in order to really create the value that's there.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the analyst Q&A. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question from the media comes from Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal. Your line is open, Alison Sider.\nAlison Sider: Thank you so much. I'm curious, you ever has been talking about sort of these different travel patterns more blended travel, you have different types of leisure trips. And I'm just curious, do those trends -- do they kind of fully offset the loss of managed corporate travel that you're still seeing? Like if there was sort of a stall in the corporate recovery with these kind of new leisure type or blended type bookings to make up for it?\nVasu Raja: Absolutely. It has way more than offset it. And then you can see it in the results, right? We have -- the contracted corporations are 80% recovered, but this is the second quarter in a row where revenues have never been higher in our history. And indeed, that's on the strength of this blended demand that's there and unmanaged business-related demand, all of which is coming in at higher yield values, all of which tends to attach itself to really high-margin ancillary products like premium cabin seats, the credit card, loyalty programs, things like that. So we're very much seeing a shift that's there and one that's really encouraging. All the more encouraging because as we look forward, really the airline revenue -- or airline revenues haven't totally recovered to their historical level. Historically, they would be about 1% of GDP. We're still not all the way there. And so we think there's yet a lot of headroom that's there. We are really encouraged and absolutely, Ali, we are very much seeing that the managed corporate hasn't come back yet. It's more than being offset. And the last thing I'll say to you is, though managed corporate hasn't come back, the really critical word in that sense is the word yet. As more countries open up, as the visa inefficiencies that Robert talked about get rectified, there's -- that can really unlock yet a lot of demand that's out there, which is kind of what are the upside for the travel business.\nAlison Sider: Got it. Thanks. And I guess, just what -- you mentioned the GDP relationship, so maybe that's part of the answer, but like what gives you the confidence that these are real permanent shifts and not just spill over for the summer and eventually, just the inflationary pressures will get speed too much and people will just travel spending will fall by the late side just like other spending categories are seeing?\nVasu Raja: Yes. Ali, look, it's a great question, and there's probably maybe three parts to the answer. First, it's not a thing that we've just observed recently. We've been seeing this and talking about this probably for a couple of quarters now, and it is a real and a meaningful shift. Two, it's not that we see the data in aggregate. We get the luxury of seeing it in particular. So for example, in 2021 and 2022, those customers on a blended trip who enrolled in our advantage program in 2022 are producing our revenue -- their revenues to us are about 10% higher than customers who traveled in '21 and '22, but didn't enroll the program. We see meaningful shifts. When people actually go and spend on the credit card, they are more likely to go and fly on the airline and vice versa. So there's a lot of things out there which are quite striking in the data that we see and are very consistent. Then the last thing that I'll mentioned is yes, even though other consumer -- demand for other consumer products is changing. Just never forget for us, in real dollars, the price of airfares are less now than what they were in 2019. So you can still go out there and now it's not like the depth of the pandemic where there were $29 one-way fares, but now they're $49 one-way fares. So air travel has never been the bargain that it is today. And we -- that's going to be a thing that lasts for quite a while going forward. Frankly, to the good of our customers and our business.\nAlison Sider: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Your line is open, Leslie Josephs.\nLeslie Josephs: Good morning everybody. I was just wondering if -- how you're thinking about the AAdvantage program and with so many people getting cards, lots of sign-ups, very high spend and accruing loss of miles. How you're thinking about just the sheer number of people that have so many miles and whether you can deliver a product that entices more people to remain in the program and to keep using it. And I'm thinking like competition for upgrades and things like that? And then my second question, in 2023, you said 95% to 100% back to 2019 levels. If you do have the aircraft, do you want to fly more? Or is there a concern that, that would drive down fares in revenue? Thanks.\nVasu Raja: Hey, Leslie, this is Vasu. I can start into that and others may want to join in for the second part of your question. So look, as we like to say it, burn begets burn. And the most important thing is people are earning more miles, we want them to keep continuing to do it. It's valuable to them. They want to be able to unlock future travel opportunities. And the really important thing is for that to happen, they need to be able to burn their miles. So stay tuned for more, but we're looking at a lot of ways where we can make status more rewarding and more meaningful and also where we can do more things where people can use their miles more. We were really encouraged this summer. We actually experimented with a lot of ways where we went and expanded availability for award redemption and things like that. And we found the take rates amongst our customers to be really promising. And so we see a lot of opportunities for that, both within AA, but also in conjunction with many of our partners. So more on that soon. And that -- if you could just repeat your second question.\nRobert Isom: Vasu, this is me, I'll add into that. Look, whether or not we're -- the Advantage members are outpacing the growth in Advantage members that are outpacing our ability to service them. Leslie, that's where we talk about what we're doing with our premium seats and making sure that we have the ability to serve customers but -- as well, we're creating world-class product as well in so many different places. Take our LaGuardia Labs. If you haven't been there, please go see it. Best domestic lounge in the country. And it's only going to be beaten when we open up our new DCA lounge. And you'll see that we're doing this kind of thing to make sure that we can accommodate a much broader group. And we're going to spend for it. It's worthwhile to do that, and we're tracking the right customers. So then the last thing is, would we be flying more right now if we -- if these constraints weren't out there, we'd be flying a little bit more, we'll take a look at that for next year. But as I said before, the biggest thing for us is making sure that we have certainty in terms of our schedule. And so we're going to make sure that we don't outpace what we have either in terms of aircraft deliveries if that's the constraint or if it's pilots at a regional level or our ability to train pilots from a mainline perspective.\nLeslie Josephs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg. Your line is open, please Mary S. Please standby. Mary S, your line is open.\nMary Schlangenstein: Yes, I'm not muted. Can you hear me?\nRobert Isom: Yes. We're hearing.\nMary Schlangenstein: Excellent. Great. Thank you. Vasu, for a long time, the thinking in the industry was that the domestic market was mature. And so the best opportunities for growth were outside of the U.S., and that seems to be the exact opposite of what you're doing now. And I wanted to see if you could comment on whether there was some sort of change, whether that belief across the industry was just an error or a misreading of the industry? And then the second question was on the 80/20 short-haul, long-haul mix. Is that 20 a base for you in terms of long-haul? Or could we see that potentially fall further going forward?\nVasu Raja: Thanks, Mary. The second of your question, it's pretty unlikely that it falls further going forward. How we build it back over time kind of remains to be seen. That's a big part of our 2023 and beyond planning. But it will be pretty surprising at this point about anything materially lower than that. And indeed, through so many of these partnerships, we probably see more ways to grow it than any desire to shrink it. Then to the first of your question that, yes, look, what I'd say is that North America, as an originating market, is a very mature market, but it's also the highest area of airline demand, the highest yielding marketplace that's anywhere in the world. And what we find is, indeed, so much of what's happened, especially post-pandemic across the U.S. is there's a significant amount of demand growth and economic growth outside of the historically large big coastal cities that are there, places like Phoenix, Arizona, Austin, Texas, Oklahoma City, places like that are growing at a pretty meaningful level. And with that, there's just a lot of people who want to be able to come in and travel. And what we do great is we connect them into the global marketplace. Whether that is New York or Heathrow or whatever the case might be. Maybe to put a bit of an example on that, like take a market like New York City, New York City is a place where there's more flights a day to Paris than there are at Little Rock, Arkansas. Well, American Airlines out of the first flight from Little Rock to New York. And it was made possible through our partnership with JetBlue and the -- but by having that, we've created opportunities for customers that they wouldn't have had before. So we see yes a lot of opportunities to do that. And indeed, the results kind of speak for it, the more that we do, the more encouraged we are that our customers value and are willing to pay for it.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Arnold of Dallas News. Your line is open, Kyle Arnold.\nKyle Arnold: Good morning everyone. Can you guys talk a little bit about how the blended travel trend is going to play into the holidays, whether you're seeing more people shift into earlier in the week outside of that, maybe pre-Thanksgiving day? And is there a different kind of cadence to that, in the summer versus the winter or maybe the winter where those peak days are a little tighter?\nVasu Raja: Hey Kyle, this is Vasu. And yes, we do see a little bit of that day of week shift. Not only do we see it just in general, a time of day shift for people who are coming out of what we call the peak business travel time channels and into the body of the airline day. We're seeing more growth happening on things like Wednesday evenings or Thursday mornings, places where -- while there was demand, it was traditionally not as great as what it would be on a Thursday evening at 6'o clock. And so with that in mind, yes, we are indeed anticipating that it's not just that the Thanksgiving weekend, for example, will be peak, but even the days around it, we'll have a level of demand. In fact, if you go look at our Thanksgiving schedule right now, there's less peak-to-trough variability there than certainly I've seen in the schedule for a number of years.\nRobert Isom: So hey Kyle, I'll add. Vasu's organization has our revenue management team in it. They -- every now they take me through the worm charts that show us how we're booking at various points in the year. And I'll tell you this, what I saw earlier this week is compared to 2019 and the prior years, look, the holidays are booking really well. And so I think that, that bodes well. But what I think Vasu, you also probably note is that getting the seat is something that's going to be hard. So it's going to place, there's going to be a move in terms of where people can fly just based on availability.\nVasu Raja: Absolutely right.\nRobert Isom: Which is a good thing. And Scott, is that our last question?\nScott Long: Yes.\nRobert Isom: Is that right? So hey I'll just close with this, which is, if you can't tell, we're pleased with our results. It's been a heck of a few years in the pandemic. And it's great to be at a point where -- not only are we reporting profits on a quarterly basis, but looking at into the future as well. Demand remains strong. We're very optimistic. And American is really in a position of strength to taking full advantage of the recovery. It's because of the things that we've done with our network, with our partnerships, with our fleet, getting the airline really situated to fly what we can do best. We are focused on reliability. And that is something that everybody in the company has top of mind. I'm really pleased with how we're performing here in October and in September and as we closed out August as well. And my confidence is bolstered by a number of things. Just first, I look at the metrics that we run every day. So things like aircraft out of service at the start of the morning, we're running record all-time lows. I got to give a shout out to our technical operations team for having our aircraft in better shape than they've ever been in but as well as things like reserve levels for our pilots and flight attendants and just making sure things are ready to go, I feel really confident the way that we recovered post the horrific Hurricanes in the flooding that was here in DFW back in August. It gives me great confidence that even when you throw enormous disruption that we can get back on our feet really quickly. That reliability translates into profitability. And yes, we said it over and over again. We have to be profitable in order to really serve the needs of our communities, our customers and the shareholders of this company. We're intent on doing it, and we're going to make sure that this airline is one that you can count on in terms of producing profits, ultimately reducing debt over time and being sustainable from a profitability perspective. So we're hard at work. We're going to get back to it as soon as we get off this call. And I appreciate everybody spending time with us, and thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call this morning, we have our CEO, Robert Isom, and our Vice Chair and CFO and President of American Eagle, Derek Kerr. Also on the call for Q&A are David Seymour, Vasu Raja and a number of other senior executives. Robert will start the call this morning with an overview of the second quarter. Derek will follow with details on the quarter and our operating plans and outlook going forward. After Derek's comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. And before we begin today, we must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast of capacity and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release, which was issued this morning as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information we're giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I want to start by thanking the American Airlines team, which has done an amazing job of running our airline, especially during very challenging operating conditions in the past few months. They managed significant weather, both thunderstorms and extreme heat in many parts of the country. Customers continue to come back to travel in record numbers. And our team has adapted to one of the busiest summers that we've ever experienced and they\u2019ve done so with grace, professionalism and a level of commitment to our customers and each other, it is second to none. Every single day, I hear from our customers about something incredible that our team has done. We're so proud of their work and grateful for their support. I also want to thank and acknowledge our key partners in the US government. Secretary Mayorkas, Secretary Buttigieg and their teams at the FAA, TSA, CVP as well as the air traffic controllers at NATCA. They've been right there with us and have worked through these difficult operating conditions. The extraordinary surge in demand for air travel has significantly impacted them as well, and we appreciate their consistency and professionalism. All of us have to acknowledge that there are challenges in the National Airspace, particularly in high traffic locations like Florida and the Northeast, but I'm grateful for the sheer commitment that we have in the public and private sectors and management on the front line to facilitate the efficient return of travel. American served 53 million customers in the quarter, and we couldn't have done that without everyone pulling together. As we have shared previously, we have two primary goals this year; running a reliable operation, and returning to profitability, and that's the entirety of our focus. We've made a lot of progress on running a reliable airline, but we have still some work to do, and I'll touch on that more in a moment. The big news is this: we're really pleased to report a quarterly profit for the first time since the start of the pandemic, that's two-and-a-half years, that's driven by the strong demand environment and the hard work of our team. We're also pleased to have hit our pretax margin guidance despite a challenging end of the quarter and a significant run-up in oil prices. American reported a second quarter GAAP net income of $476 million. Excluding net special items, we reported a second quarter net income of $533 million. American produced revenues of $13.4 billion in the second quarter and that's an increase of 12.2% versus 2019 and a record for any quarter in the company's history. And let me repeat that: That's a record for any quarter in our company's history. These results were achieved while flying 8.5% less capacity than we did in 2019. Importantly, these results are an indication that our actions are producing the expected results. Early in the pandemic, we made a conscious decision to simplify our fleet and network, focusing our flying where we could create outsized customer value and using partnerships to augment that service. In the second quarter, some 70% of our flying was in American's areas of strength, our Sunbelt hubs, Mexico, Caribbean, Latin America and London. This flying outperformed the industry as we offer customers more options than any other airline. Our domestic partnerships are also producing for our customers and for us. As a matter of fact, our unit revenue performance in JFK and Los Angeles outperformed the system in the second quarter. Customers are flying in different patterns than they have previously, and that's creating opportunities for us. System business revenue is now fully recovered compared to 2019, with revenue from small and medium businesses and customers exhibiting a blended behaviors that were traditionally associated with both business and leisure continuing to outpace the recovery of our managed corporate revenue. The majority of this revenue growth has come directly through our website, bypassing traditional channels. Further, leisure demand surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter, and customers continue to show us their increasing appetite for travel. Enrollments in our loyalty program continue at record levels, and spend on our co-brand cards is growing at a greater rate than ever before. Looking forward, we will limit capacity to the resources we have and the operating conditions we face. We will continue to orient our flying to create value for our customers. And as always, we will remain nimble to ensure that we are best positioned to capitalize on continued demand strength. Now turning back to reliability. After running a solid operation in April and May, headlined by a strong Memorial Day, we had challenges in June. June was a difficult month for the entire industry from an operational perspective, with extreme weather impacting every major hub and air traffic control challenges in certain parts of the country. At American, we encountered significant weather on 27 of the 30 days in June. That weather resulted in ramp closures, ground stops, ground delay programs, airspace flow programs, which had a ripple effect throughout our operations. Despite the challenging operating environment in June, our D0, that\u2019s departures on time, A14, arrivals within 14 minutes and completion factor for the full quarter were better than the second quarter of 2019. Our team achieved this while flying a second quarter schedule that was more than 25% larger than our closest competitor on a departure basis. American operated more than 0.5 million flights in the quarter. That's an 8% increase over the second quarter of 2021 with a load factor of 87%, which is 10 points higher than the second quarter of 2021. While June was challenging, we have seen improvements so far in July, including over the busy Independence Day weekend. American finished the holiday period with a combined D0 A14 and completion factor, all above goal and in line with our pre-pandemic performance, while operating a July 4 holiday schedule that was 30% larger than our competitors as measured by total departures. Our operational performance for the full quarter and the results we have delivered in the first few weeks of July give us confidence moving forward, but we still aren't where we need to be. And we have a lot of flying ahead of us still in the summer. So we are investing in our operations to ensure we meet our reliability goals and deliver for our customers. We've taken proactive steps to build additional buffer into our schedule for the rest of the year. As I said a minute ago, we're sizing the airline for the resources we have available and the operating conditions we face, and we will make other changes as needed. Even with these adjustments, American still offers customers the largest network of any US airline with an average of more than 5,400 daily departures. So I want to close by reiterating that I'm tremendously excited about what lies ahead for American. We're encouraged by the trends we're seeing across the business, and we've built an airline that can be successful in a number of different demand and economic environments. Our second quarter results and strong revenue production despite challenging conditions demonstrates that our plan to return to profitability and deliver a good operation for our customers is working. We have the strongest assets in the industry, and the work that our team has accomplished to build and deliver the most comprehensive network in the business is paying off. And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to thank the American Airlines team for their continued dedication to our customers during this busy summer travel season. This morning, we reported a second quarter GAAP net income of $476 million or earnings of $0.68 per diluted share. Excluding net special items, we reported a net income of $533 million or earnings of $0.76 per diluted share. We talk a lot about our goal of returning the airline to profitability, and our second quarter performance is a result of that focus. Profitability in the quarter was driven by record revenue performance. As Robert noted, our second quarter revenue was $13.4 billion was 12.2% higher despite flying 8.5% less capacity than the same period in 2019. Leisure demand continued to lead the way, but the acceleration of business and long-haul international demand contributed to the strength we saw in the quarter. Operating earnings improved sequentially through the quarter, in line with the growth in revenue despite rising fuel cost. We continue to reap the benefit of the past investments in our fleet and are well-positioned for the future. In the second quarter, we took delivery of five A321neos and reactivated nine Boeing 737-800s from long-term storage. We continue to work closely with Boeing and the timing of our delayed 788s, and we expect to begin taking delivery of those aircraft this quarter. We now expect to receive nine 788s this quarter and four this year and four in the first part of 2023. Lastly, based on our latest guidance from Airbus, we are now expecting our A321 XLRs to be delivered starting in the first quarter of 2024 instead of the third quarter of 2023. This will shift planned aircraft capacity out of 2023 into future years. Our 2023 aircraft CapEx is now expected to be $1.9 billion. We ended the second quarter with $15.6 billion of total available liquidity. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $1.7 billion and free cash flow of more than $800 million. Total debt reduction remains a top priority. We remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025. In the near term, we will continue to keep up -- keep our liquidity at elevated levels, with a plan to step down to $10 billion to $12 billion when we are confident the recovery has fully taken hold. At that time, any excess liquidity will be prioritized to reduce debt. During the quarter, we made $1 billion in scheduled debt and finance lease payments, including paying off the remaining outstanding balance of our $750 million unsecured senior notes that matured in June. To date, we have reduced overall debt levels by $5.2 billion from peak levels in the second quarter of 2021. This means that after only 12 months, we have completed more than one-third of our $15 billion total debt reduction target. This progress affords us tremendous flexibility as to when and how we bring down the remaining $10 billion in total debt by the end of 2025. As we have said previously, moving forward, we will continue to balance our total liquidity and with the expected demand recovery, debt reduction opportunities and investment in the business. We expect to make $375 million of scheduled debt payments in the third quarter, which includes the scheduled payoff and unencumbering of 8 CRJ-700 aircraft. As we look to the remainder of the year, we are making targeted investments to ensure operational reliability. With recent schedule adjustments, we now expect full year 2022 capacity to be recovered to 90.5% to 90.5% of 2019 levels. Consequently, we now expect our full year CASM excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 10% and 12% versus 2019. The increase in unit cost is driven by lower planned capacity and other investments to support the operation, including wage premiums and regional pilot pay. These unit cost increases represent near-term investments that will drive long-term value. We are confident that unit costs will improve as we increase asset utilization to historical levels. In the third quarter, we expect to be profitable despite the continuation of elevated fuel prices. Pretax margins are expected to be between 2% and 4% for the quarter, based on the current demand trends and our latest fuel price forecast. We currently expect total revenue to be 10% to 12% higher versus the third quarter of 2019 on 8% to 10% lower capacity. On this revenue strength, we expect total revenue per ASM to be 20% to 24% higher in the third quarter versus the same period in 2019. We expect our third quarter CASM, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 12% and 14% compared to 2019. Lower planned capacity and the investment in the reliability of the operation that I mentioned previously are driving unit costs higher for the quarter. Our current forecast for the third quarter assumes fuel between $3.73 and $3.78 per gallon, an increase of more than 80% versus the price of fuel in the third quarter of 2019. In conclusion, demand is strong, and we remain focused on our key objectives of operational reliability and profitability. While we've made investments in our operations that will impact near-term costs, we are confident that we're very well positioned as we move into 2023, because of our network, our fleet, our team and the actions we have taken. With that, we will open up the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Yeah. Hey, good morning everyone. Hey, good job this quarter and good outlook. I guess, Derek, first to you on the $5.2 billion debt reduction that you've been able to do thus far. Presumably, you're not including any sort of reduction in the pension obligation. And just given the run-up in interest rates and thinking where the discount rate would go, can you just give us a sense of maybe the potential tailwind on that from a deleveraging perspective, where things stand and how you're thinking about that pension obligation? Thanks.\nDerek Kerr: Yeah. Two things. One is we look at that at the end of the year. So there was some benefit in the pension. The reduction in 2021, there was a slight reduction in 2021 of the pension obligation. As we look at where we're at now as of June 30th, the actual pension status or funding ratio has gone up to about 81%, and the liabilities have dropped over $3.5 billion due to the interest rate change and it's a higher interest rate, which has more than offset the asset reduction. So it's actually in a much better spot than it was before, not the way we want to get there, without a doubt, but it is in a better spot from a pension liability standpoint. But we have not added that in for anything in 2022. But if we did, it'd be -- right now, it would be about $1 billion lower from a liability perspective from a debt perspective than it would be before. So we are managing it the way we would any other time staying very conservative in our pension and watching it. But the interest rate has actually driven the liability much, much lower than what the reduction in the asset class has been.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. That's helpful. And then this second question, and this is probably more for Vasu, Derek, you said that you're going to get nine 787s this quarter. And I know that everybody's been -- that has slipped multiple times. And assuming that it does slip again, when I look in the fourth quarter, it does look like you do have the 787 scheduled in -- it's in your timetable. If, for some reason, that were to slip again, like how many points of capacity do those airplanes account for in the back part of the year? Thanks.\nDerek Kerr: Yeah. Well, two things, Mike, I corrected that, I think, in my comments, but it is nine for the year. We will have two coming in, I think, in early August. The first two will come earlier, and we don't have any of them built into the schedule until November time frame. So if those do slip from August a little bit, we have put in almost a two-month pad in those coming in. But we don't think it will impact the fourth quarter a lot. If they slip a lot further, where the impact is going to be into 2023, not a lot into 2022.\nVasu Raja: And Mike, presuming that all nine do deliver, call that roughly about deploying of capacity in a month.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Okay, great. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator.\nDerek Kerr: Hi, Helane. Good morning.\nHelane Becker: Good morning. Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Hi Helane.\nHelane Becker: Hi. So just two questions. The first question, Robert, I saw you on CNBC this morning, and you talked about the pilot contract. And I know you guys don't like to talk about it, but you did present your pilots with an offer that would increase pay by 17% by 2025, I think. Could you just talk about what happens next and the status of that?\nRobert Isom: Sure. So Helane, thanks for the question. Look, it's really important for us to take care of our pilots. You know that throughout the pandemic, we had put an offer on the table that would have made our pilots the most highly paid pilots in the industry. We never pulled that back even throughout the pandemic. But, look, United went out and put out a better offer. And we thought it was really important to get to the table to make sure that our pilots know that we were going to take care of them. So we've done that. And now we are negotiating very closely and actively. And my hope is that we make progress over the coming weeks and months. Now how that bakes into financial forecast, we haven't put anything in yet. We don't know exactly where we'll end up. And then the point I'd just make is that, with every contract, not only are there changes to compensation and quality of life, but we think that when we get to a contract, we'll have a contract that is -- that operates very efficiently for the company as well.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up question on London. I know Phil asked you about that, too. And I heard Scott say last night that London operations will call him up and tell him a day or two in advance they're canceling flights. I don't think you guys have as many flights to London as they do. But are you seeing the same issues? And is that -- and maybe how does that get fixed, or is it more a British Air problem and a partner problem?\nRobert Isom: No. Let me start with this. First off, we have a really sizable operation in London, Heathrow with our Atlantic joint business partner, BA. We offer the largest schedule into London Heathrow. So it's very important to us. One of the things that we've done is we've been able to isolate American's operations into T3. And so that has allowed us with our team to make sure that we're doing everything possible. Now all that said, there's so much that you can do with your own team members. There's infrastructure like bag systems that you're dependent on Heathrow. And then, of course, BA is incredibly dependent on Heathrow as well. To that end, we're working as a group with our oneworld carriers to make sure that we match our capacity to the resources that are there -- that will take some time to work our way through. And to that end, maybe I'll have Nate Gatten, our Head of Government Affairs and Corporate Real Estate add to what's going on and the prognosis for that.\nNate Gatten: Yes. Thanks, Robert. Helane, we worked whole last week on extremely short notice to cancel departing flights as a way to help manage airport crowding. And as Robert said, we've found that request to be quite disappointing and frustrating on many levels, mostly because of the significant burn that would put on our customers under short notice with few options for rebooking, given the -- some of those. What we did then was work with [HAL] (ph) to limit the capacity on our departing flights by capping loads on certain flights, we've rebooked passengers over other European points of departure, did things like limit non-rev travel, et cetera. And as Robert mentioned, we did that in conjunction with our oneworld and JV partners. It's important to understand that -- these procedures will be in place until the beginning of next week, at which point a new procedure for limiting passengers at Heathrow is going to be instituted this time by the slot coordinators. And we don't have the full details on how that's going to work yet, but the new arrangement would probably continue to impact all the airlines serving Heathrow through the second week in September. So I would just say we're very disappointed in the circumstances. We have high load factors this summer. Again, we're told by the airport at the very last minute that they can't handle the passengers and that we need to reduce the capacity. And just final point, fortunately, we don't see these same kinds of caps on the horizon in the United States, but we do expect to face similar issues and challenges that additional international locations through the summer.\nRobert Isom: Hey Helane, I'll just close with this. Look, we're going to put these measures in place, work with the airport authorities. At the end of the day, we've got to match capacity to the resources that are available, and we're going to push hard to make sure that all of the airports that we work with get resources they need to serve our operations at the size that it should be. So thanks for the question.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much. Have a great day team.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question coming from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey good morning. I guess since Helane brought up London, I flew back on American yesterday, nothing but positive things to say. I'll take that up with Scott offline. First question for Vasu. So last quarter, you brought up a phenomenon of corporate travelers combining business with pleasure, extending trips, bringing the spouse, that sort of thing. With another 90 days of corporate recovery under your belt now, I mean, is the trend any different? And to the extent that this is sustainable, is there a way to actually monetize it, or is it just sort of gravy? If it happens, great, if not, no biggie?\nVasu Raja: Hi Jamie, thanks for the question. And the topic, which is very frequently on our minds here because indeed, in the last 90 days and be the nine months or 12 months before that, the trends have not abated. In fact, they've grown even stronger. I mentioned in our last call when you asked the question, that it used to be as much as 70%, 75% of our revenues could be both identified and would self-classify itself very binary as traveling only for business or only for leisure, and now that's only 50%. And that other 50% that's there indeed is still there. It tends to be higher yielding. It comes to a directly through our dot-com and mobile. And it's looking for -- and it does that largely because it's looking for travel experiences and journeys and things like that, which the industry hasn't been able to make available through the very antiquated technologies and things like that that we've been prone to using. So yes, this really has opened our eyes to creating a lot of value for these kinds of customers who are a growing number. Like all of our advantage enrollments are coming out of that population, they're disproportionately concentrated in places where American has just a lot of natural strength. Think of the Sunbelt, Midwest, the Southeast. So we're really encouraged by what we see. And indeed, it's proven through the pandemic to be a very durable source of demand that's both high-yielding and wants a lot more in the airline product than just a single transaction. So it is very much on our minds, and it's probably going to shape a lot of view in the months and quarters ahead.\nJamie Baker: Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then second question, probably for Derek or Robert, but the demand data is obviously super encouraging. You're smaller than you were pre-COVID, but you're generating more revenue. I mean, that's -- it's a great strategy for many businesses, I suppose, but your margins aren't recovered, and you weren't satisfied with your pre-COVID margins to begin with. So simple question, what are the drivers of higher margins from here?\nRobert Isom: Well, Jamie, let me start with just -- from the top, and then Derek can go into more detail. Look, there's more margin growth at American. We've resourced this airline to fly a larger airline, just plain and simple. We've built in a lot of redundancies. And even in June, those redundancies weren't enough. But over time, we know that we can utilize our assets a lot harder than we have been able to, to this point. And as you take a look going forward in terms of margins, I know that the third quarter, look, we've pulled out some additional flying, and that's fine that we would rather do. You know that we have regional aircraft that aren't in the air. And while we may not have the pilots, we have the other resources to actually fly those aircraft. So the key to us is ultimately to be able to use our assets at a higher rate. But Derek, go ahead.\nDerek Kerr: No, I was going to say the exact same things. And Jamie, as we look at the second quarter, we talked about 100 regional aircraft being out on the ground, and we had probably about 40 mainline aircraft -- equivalent aircraft on the ground. So you're talking about 150 -- 140, 150 aircraft that aren't being utilized. So two things have to happen is, the resources come and we put those aircraft back up in the air. We've got to get out of those aircraft. So we really want to fly all those. We want to get back to the utilization that we were at, and that is where the margin comes because, as Robert said, we are built from a cost perspective to fly those aircraft. And today, we're not. So that's where it's at, and that's where we believe as we get ourselves back up to ASM levels in the 2019, it comes at a much cheaper cost because the assets are here.\nRobert Isom: And Jamie, just to add one other point, just from even a second quarter perspective. The month of June was really hard on the airline. 27 out of 30 days, we had severe weather that resulted in ramp closures, ground staff, ground delay programs, aerospace flow programs. And in sum, we flew at least a percentage point or more, less than we would have otherwise. June and the second quarter would have been better had we seen a more normal type close to the quarter. So that gives me optimism that there's not only utilization that we can work our way out of, but also more normal operating conditions are going to benefit us as we go forward as well.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Take care.\nOperator: One moment for next question. Our next question coming from the line Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. If I might on -- just a kind of a follow-up to Jamie's question there. So if you look at versus 2019, just how much has kind of inflation been built in? I know you have kind of this regional pilot pay that's kind of builds in there. So how much of these kind of increases are structural versus what could we -- like if I take your either 3Q or your kind of full year unit cost, like how much is structural versus how much could we see go away as you get back to 2019 level capacity?\nDerek Kerr: Well, I would say as we look at the cost structure, the cost trading we talked about is built to fly another 150 aircraft. So we did add cost in. So if you take the third quarter over the second quarter, the increase is really driven by three things, which is mainline salaries due to putting in some of the pilot contract issues, the maintenance is up year-over-year just because of engine overhauls and things that we\u2019re seeing throughout the summer. And then the regional plan I would say that\u2019s put into place. So, the regional plan is put into place to get more aircraft up in the air. So, that hopefully that is there, it\u2019s there to stay engine of higher cost to fly regional and the new contract that we would put in place regional is there. That hopefully drives more aircraft back up in the air. We\u2019ll see where that goes. If it doesn't, then that cost doesn't come. So I think those things are built in, they're going to be there as we move forward. So it's important for us to get the utilization back up and get the aircraft in the air.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. And if I can ask just a follow-up on that regional pilot pay. The pay was surprising, and I understand that at least part of it is a bonus that supposedly rolls off in 2024. But given how, kind of, much the gap versus mainline pay has been narrowed or, in some cases, even higher than mainline pay, just is that sustainable from an economic standpoint for those markets because you're flying them with small aircraft, fuel is a bigger impact on those smaller markets? Is that sustainable long-term, or is it the right move right now because maybe because capacity is out of those markets and fares are high, or you just need to get this capacity back up? I was just kind of curious as the thinking behind that big of a pay increase?\nRobert Isom: Savi, let me start and then I know some others might want to jump in. The answer to that is yes. Look, the regional network to American Airlines is incredibly important, and whether it's 50 or 65 or 76-seat aircraft, being able to serve those markets in a way that connects to our hubs and then unleashes the breadth of the rest of our network, that's a really compelling offering that achieves higher yields. And so even though pilot expense for those regional aircraft will be going up, we're confident that the yields that will be introduced we'll take that into account. But one thing I want to make clear, though, is as we take a look at regional pilot pay, but it costs quite a bit of money to become a pilot. And the expectations for a pilot coming out and saying taking that first job, right, they have changed over time. So as we look forward, I do think that as an industry, pilot wages are going to increase. And that's something that the industry as a whole is going to have to digest. And ultimately, that will show up through our cost structure and be a factor in terms of how we try to monetize our product.\nVasu Raja: Yeah. Savi, this is Vasu. I'll just add that to what Robert said in this, but for our airline in particular, so much of how we create value and drive margins is by creating as many unique O&Ds as we can. And you've seen it through many quarters now where we've flown more capacity in the industry that can produce higher, but there are good nominal PRASM, at least as good, if not better than what our network competitors are, certainly in domestic and short haul. And a major part of that is the regional jet. In this last quarter, we flew 20% -- we had 20% more O&Ds than what our next largest network competitor did. And in those markets, we are seeing yields that are 25% greater than what happened to the rest of the system. Indeed, that's what's really driving the yield growth that's there. And many of those markets are where we see the high-value blended demand that Jamie asked about earlier. So indeed, not only is it something sustainable. It's something which is a unique feature of what we do and always will be.\nSavi Syth: Appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe we'll start where Savi just left off. So, I guess, anybody could do what you're doing on the pay side. So it's hard to see how that's a unique benefit. So, historically, on the regional side that pay arbitrage was one of the reasons that profitability worked. So why is -- why are pay increases like this the right answer from a profitability perspective? I understand why they might be the right answer from a small market, market share perspective. But why is that a better answer than your peers from a margin perspective?\nRobert Isom: Duane, let me start. Well, first off, again, the days of being able to go out and attract a pilot for wages that are $40,000 a year, okay, are gone. I don't think that we're going to return to an environment where that is the type of compensation that regional pilots make. It's a different world. And for pilots coming in, we're still not talking about exorbitant salaries. And I think that, that is something that, no matter the carrier, they're going to face the issues of having to pay higher rates for pilots. That said, there is a uniqueness about American Airlines network that allows us to use regional -- our regional network and our regional pilots in a fashion that produces outsized yield. That's what will differentiate us. It's not that, hey, we're going to go out and be able to have a slight difference in terms of pilot wages and that's going to make the difference in terms of the margin we make as a company. Vasu, you want to add something?\nVasu Raja: Yes, I'll just add to it very simply, Duane, an industry that has struggled for a long time to be able to pass its cost into revenue, at least for us, what we've seen time and time again with the regionals is, anytime there has been a cost increase, that is the one part of the business where we can most consistently pass it through to revenues. And we do it because of what it does. It creates a unique product for customers that increasingly nobody else but American Airlines can go and do. And when you look through our system, right, there's many of those markets that you simply couldn't upgauge. And even if you did upgauge it, flying to large cities, Birmingham, Alabama, Wilmington, North Carolina, once a day in a 737, doesn't really create a lot of utility for what those really big metro areas in the US. So for us, this is actually a place where by doing it, and frankly, by doing it through our wholly owned regional jets, which themselves are very massive airlines, it creates a lot of unique value for our customers, which turns into revenue for us.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate that perspective. And then, just one thing that's a little confusing to me, can you clear up the difference in characterization on corporate? A couple of your peers call it sort of 80% recovered. Perhaps you carried kind of less of that premium traffic going in. Maybe differences in hub geography explains it. But why do you see it as sort of fully recovered versus the 80%? And if much more of it is coming through your own distribution, how do you know it's corporate? Thanks for taking the questions.\nVasu Raja: Yeah. Thanks, Duane. And I think this is an important clarification because I think that maybe throughout the industry, people use a lot of different words or the same words to mean different things. Let me be really specific about what we do. When we talk about business, we talk about a trip type that is business. And this is Jamie's question. We're able to go and calibrate it on. We ask customers did you actually buy for business, and we can actually go and look at it. Was it a single person in the itinerary? They didn't check a bag. They did a day trip, likely business, right? And so business revenue is that. And for us, historically, that business revenue has been 40% to 45%. Of that, a component of it, historically, there is a 60/40 split between what we consider unmanaged or small businesses and really managed businesses. These are large corporations that contract, travel globally typically, right? They use large travel agencies to help them manage the program. And so for us, what we see is that business revenue is indeed 40% to 45% recovered. The nature of it has changed materially, though, where that unmanaged business is 125% to 130% recovered and that managed or contracted corporate business is indeed about 75% to 80% recovered, maybe consistent with other things that you've heard. That, of course -- and that's the thing that we've been seeing for some time. This seems to be a relatively durable trend and one that will continue, which is that there's going to be more and more unmanaged business out there. And indeed, we see even with those accounts that are contracted corporate accounts, as we emerge from the pandemic, fewer and fewer of them are enforcing travel policies are doing a lot of the things that they contracted to begin with anyway. So that's a trend, which we anticipate will continue. And hopefully, that clarifies the point too.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: It does. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, good morning guys. So Robert and Derek, I want to talk a little bit about the rate of recovery in either pre-tax or operating margins. You were down on pre-tax sort of 390 bps close to 2019 in the second quarter. It looks the same on a September level. And I'm just trying to get a sense for when we should start to expect to see those pre-tax margins recover. And is that all 100% driven by volume recovery, or is there something to do on the revenue side or the cost side to accelerate the rate of change in the profit margin?\nRobert Isom: Well, I'll just start. David, look, this gets back to the question that's asked earlier. We have a lot of redundancy built into the business utilization isn't where we need it. I think that as we take a look to the future, we're depending on a couple of things. One is, fortunately, we're in a really strong revenue environment and as we're looking to the third quarter, anticipating [Technical Difficulty] revenue environment. And as we're looking to the third quarter, anticipating 20% to 24% increases in TRASM versus 2019. From a cost perspective, that's where we would like to see unit costs come in lower. And the big driver to that is making sure that we fly a more fulsome schedule and take out the redundancy that we have built in. And it gets back again to how quickly we can get these tests back up, from a regional perspective, get the 787s back in. And my view is that, that's the name of the game for us as we go forward. And as we take a look into the rest of 2022 and 2023, our goal is to make sure that we're utilizing our assets as hard as we possibly can.\nDavid Vernon: And if I'm going to play devil's advocate and say, this isn't necessarily the case that we're thinking about, but in a world where we don't get that capacity and recovery, the conversation within the company or the Board around maybe restructuring asset level, that resource level to some new level of lower, not saying that's a base case. But I'm just wondering, as you guys think about managing the organization through the next couple of years here, if we end up in a world where that next 10% of ASM, the demand just isn't there, what are the levers that you could pull to maybe get the source level down?\nRobert Isom: Hey, David, I mean, you've nailed it. We will size the airline for the demand that's out there. So right now, there's more demand than we'd like to be servicing. We have the capacity to be able to do it. But as time goes forward, if that demand doesn't materialize, what we will do is we will size the airline appropriately. We have flexibility within our fleet to be able to take out, I believe, everything that we would need to in terms of matching demand going forward. And on top of that, then we would size the resources around it, including all of the people resources. Now on that front, we have great flexibility, because we're hiring so many folks just to make sure that we can run the airline as we need to. So whether it's a people perspective, whether it's a fleet perspective, we have the ability to size the airline for the demand in fact that's out there.\nDerek Kerr: Yes. I'll add some numbers there, David. In 2023, we've got 95 lease renewals; 2024, 72 lease renewals. We have unencumbered aircraft of over 200 aircraft. We have deliveries coming in. In 2023, we have 31 and 2024, 47. So that is exactly right. What you said is what we would do. We're not there yet, because we believe that the demand is there to get more of these aircraft up. But if we see that, then that is what we would do is, not renew leases, push deliveries like we have in the past. You saw us last quarter push out some deliveries on the 789s and make sure that we right-size those. And then we would take some of the unencumbered assets, and we would move those and sell those and not put them back up in the air. So that's where we would go. You're exactly right.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Daniel McKenzie with Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nDaniel McKenzie: Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Going back to the commentary of more margin growth over time, setting aside market expectations for a recession, and just putting a finer point on the prior commentary, all else equal, based on what you see today, are the initiatives in place to offset the structurally higher costs in this next cycle? So just putting a finer point on getting back to margins in the last cycle or actually exceeding those? Because in the past, the commentary seemed pretty bullish for doing a little bit better than what you've done on your historical margins.\nRobert Isom: So, hey, Daniel. Thanks for the question, and others might chime in here, too. I'll bring us back a little bit because I think the -- what we're focusing on right now is getting back to sustained profitability. So we've reported within guide this quarter despite really challenging operating conditions. We're expecting profitability as we go into the third quarter. And our intent is to stay in the black, okay? That's job number one. As we go out, it's still a murky environment out there, right? We're recovering from the pandemic. And we're doing so well. We know that demand now is back and back strong. There are so many constraints out there in terms of aircraft deliveries, in terms of just people and pilots that, look, we think that we're going to be in a position where we have the ability to improve revenue performance and get higher utilization out of the assets that we have. That bodes well for the future. But I'm reluctant to look too far out to 2023, and say that there are certain margins that we will or will not hit. And I'll leave it at that unless anybody else wants to chime in.\nDerek Kerr: No. But I would say, yeah, that is our goal and that we know where we were in 2019. We know what those pre-tax EBITDA margins are. Getting the asset utilization back up where the demand environment is, would get us back to those levels. So it is all about moving forward, getting the asset utilization where it needs to be to get the aircraft back up in the air, and we can reach those levels for sure.\nVasu Raja: And Dan, let me pick up where Derek left off, too. In this way, if you think about American Airlines prior to the pandemic, we flew more capacity than many of our competitors, but we've produced certainly lower nominal PRASM than what many of our -- certainly, what the industry leader at the time was. And through the pandemic, we've done a lot. In fact, this is Robert's commentary really. We didn't just simplify the fleet. We also concentrated the network where 70% to 75% of it is flying in places where we can create really outsized consumer value, Sunbelt, NC, L.A., Heathrow, and we've really leaned hard into partnerships to create value where we couldn't organically, and now we're in a place where really for a couple of quarters, we can fly 5% to 15% more capacity than the 2019 PRASM, but produced PRASMs that are pretty comparable to that. So that's when we say getting asset utilization up and running, it's a meaningful thing. But the thing that has to be lost is that doesn't mean we're putting back 2019. Like there's not a world where we're going to go back into flying money and losing flights for strategic purposes or things like that. There's not a world where we go and complicate it. But there is one where we've really realized more unique O&Ds we create, the more that turns into real revenue production for the airline. And that's the basis to go build off of and, from that, a lot more as possible it will be.\nDaniel McKenzie: Yeah. Understood. Thanks for that. A question on the regional operation. What does it look like one to three years from now, same, size, smaller? And as you look at the percent of the regional network that's competing against mainline aircraft, where is that today? And is -- where would you like to see it? And is that an opportunity for helping to drive margin expansion?\nRobert Isom: Daniel, it's absolutely been an opportunity to drive margin expansion. First goal is to just get all the aircraft that we have back up and flying. And so our fleet is -- our regional aircraft is roughly 600 aircraft. Love to get those back up. And over time, there will be changes in terms of mix to that fleet, but it will be based on how effective it supports our hubs and the rest of the mainline operation, too. So first goal and one that I think will take the next couple of years for sure is to get to all 600 back up and flying.\nDaniel McKenzie: Thanks for your time, guys.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question coming from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, guys and thank you for the time. I echo Jamie's comments. I don't know if you guys were screening for airline analysts going into Heathrow, but my experience of American was pretty good.\nRobert Isom: All right. That\u2019s I\u2019d like to hear.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe just talking to your other large hubs. If you could talk about unit revenue in JFK and LAX, you mentioned in your prepared remarks it's outperforming the total system. Can you maybe provide some color on that? Is that relative to 2019 or on an absolute unit revenue basis across the system?\nVasu Raja: Yes. Hey, thanks for the question. This is Vasu. And the answer is both. To Robert's specific point, that is compared to our system in absolute. But let me provide a little bit of context behind the point. For us, historically, in New York, especially New York Kennedy and L.A., American Airlines typically produced unit revenues that were, let's call it, 90% of what the industry produce to its domestic system. And now those are starting to get -- both in New York Kennedy and in Los Angeles, we're starting to produce unit revenues that are much more in line with the domestic system. This is material for us because our largest hubs where our capacity concentration is still great; are able to produce unit revenues at a real advantage to what our competitors are able to do. So we were able to go and serve these markets with higher unit revenues as it bleeds through. It's something that we tend to look at really, really closely. But what we're really most encouraged about in New York and L.A. is this isn't just a function of going in there and cutting a bunch of flights or growing RASM. We've improved the consumer proposition that's there. In New York, certainly, we -- between American Airlines and JetBlue, our Northeast Alliance has put back more capacity sooner than anybody else. We've launched new routes. We've taken the American Airlines metal in the market like Delta in India that, two or three years ago, would have been relatively unthinkable, and our consumers are responding. We're seeing originating market share, both in that partnership and also our West Coast partnership with Alaska, and that's coming directly away from our large network competitors. So we're encouraged by the whole thing. And really the context for it is, this consumer proposition is starting to bleed its way into the unit revenue results, and that's most encouraging of all.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you for that color, Vasu. And then, maybe, just following up on the regional questions. Is there any way to think about the current impact of subdued regional operations on the mainline operation and the traffic you're missing out on?\nVasu Raja: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question, Sheila? We missed that part here.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Sorry. Can you -- just talking about the regional operations, is there any way to quantify how much you're missing out on traffic because of subdued regional operations?\nVasu Raja: Because of subdued regional operations, got it. It's really difficult to do. We've actually taken a couple of cuts at it, because the reality is that, this is such a sort of unprecedented time of the industry where there are so many constraints on the infrastructure, so many issues with aircraft deliveries, resources, things like that. But it's hard to really isolate what effect it is. In fact, when we look at it, what we find is through the pandemic, we've been able to sustain a lot more of the connectivity of our system through the regional jets. And those places where we've sustained the connectivity are really what's driving our yield growth. And it's bringing in new customers that are not in necessarily large coastal metro areas. So it's hard to kind of isolate it just because there are so many variables at play, but for Robert and Derek's commentary, the regional jet, especially the wholly-owned regional jet is really key to helping our mainline fleet grow and recover its utilization.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hey good morning, everyone. Vasu, just a question on your 3Q revenue guide. When I look at other airlines, I think you guys are now the one that's not pointing to a sequential acceleration in total revenue growth 2Q to 3Q. Why do you think that is? And are you just trying to be a little bit more conservative given what's going on out there in the macro environment right now?\nVasu Raja: Well, let me start by saying, we're actually really encouraged by demand. I mean, the demand for our product has been high in a historical way. That continues. And indeed, the way demand is coming back is both really encouraging and somewhat different than what was there before from my earlier commentary. But really, when you see when you go from 2Q to 3Q is, first of all, just a change in capacity production. We're taking a more conservative view of just how we size the airlines and the resources we have for Robert's comments, and that impacts a lot of it. And then beyond that, really, there's a wide range that we have in unit revenue production because we're really encouraged by the trends that we see. But if we've learned anything over the last couple of quarters, things could go change a lot. But right now, our optimism -- but we see nothing to really materially that excludes our optimism in any way.\nAndrew Didora: Okay, understood. And then I've just been thinking, given the operational challenges across the entire industry, do you think that all -- that's going to influence the way maybe corporate's willingness to travel come the fall? Have you or Robert had any conversations with your big managed corporate clients that have maybe expressed concerns over this operational reliability? Just curious your thoughts on that? Thanks.\nVasu Raja: Look, I'll start and then others can pick up, too. Part of it -- and this kind of goes to some of my earlier commentary. One of the things that we're seeing is that like large corporate, large contract corporations are starting to just use different tools than what they had before. Prior to the pandemic, if corporations wanted to go and manage travel behavior, they could create more elaborate travel policies and hire a range of consultants and other firms to help manage that. But now through the pandemic, video conferencing has become normalized. There's a lot more flexibility in the workplace and things like that. And so what we see actually is, in a lot of cases, corporations, so they may be -- they may not be enforcing travel policies as much as there was before. There is a lot more latitude. And so we'll see customers who will often supply out of their travel policy will pay more for a service that might have been there before, but they might be traveling less if they're worried about, for example, issues at London Heathrow. So at large, we're really encouraged by what we see. But the way corporations are probably going to go and manage this as a practical matter, it's probably going to be very different than what was there. And we see that in the data, right? There's fewer people who are very conforming to a travel policy. It's hard to see how that changes. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, because we continue to see demand come in, and we're encouraged about where it may go, even if it goes to -- if it comes back differently.\nRobert Isom: Hey, Andrew. I'll just add one other point. And it's just this. Look, travel is coming back in record numbers, which is fantastic. And we have set really, really high standards for ourselves in terms of operational reliability. We, look, start out every day, doing everything we can to get every single passenger every flight to where it used to go on time. But if you take a look at really what's going on in the second quarter, okay, we're not that far in terms of overall operating performance from where we have been historically. As a matter of fact, in the second quarter, American did better than it did in 2019. And if you take a look back at prior quarters of history, we're not that far off from other points as well. The fact of the matter is, is that, look, we have operating conditions that we have to be sensitive to. I can't, nor can anyone else do anything about 27 out of 30 days of really severe weather in a number of our hubs that just ultimately result in flight canceling and that rolling from day to day. And when we talk about weather, please understand this, it's not weather. It's safety, okay? When there are air traffic control programs, when there's weather, when there's -- we're doing -- we're taking access to make sure that we ensure the safety of our folks, of not just our customers but also the people on the ground. When ramps close, it's due to widening strikes. And so those kind of things are things that we're always going to take into account. And you know what, there will be seasonal variability to what we do. Everybody is working very hard. I know that our government partners are working very hard. The airlines are working very hard, and I know that the rest of the world will get to where the United States is, which, in the scheme of things, United States is doing very well compared to the rest of the world.\nAndrew Didora: Very clear. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is open.\nStephen Trent: Good morning, everybody and thanks very much for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to something you mentioned earlier about investments that you've been making that have affected your near-term cost. I think people are pretty aware that you guys are making a big effort on the pilot side, and that makes sense. But could you elaborate maybe outside of crew, whether you're making digital type investments or other processes that can improve your throughput? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Yes. Let me ask Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer to step in here.\nMaya Leibman: Hi. We're super excited about a lot of the digital enhancements that we've been making. I'll separate them, as Robert said, into our main goals of operational reliability and profitability. On the reliability side, we've done so much to really shore up how we responded in irregular operation to bring our crews back together. We've also really enhanced some focus on how we do gating at some of our larger airports like Dallas and Charlotte. And when we get better at that, what happens is we reduce the taxi times. So we save fuel. We dedicate more time to the turn, and we better utilize our assets. We've also done some interesting work in creating algorithms that help us, especially in markets like Charlotte, where we get these pop-up thunderstorms, where we can actually slow down the operation a little bit rather than use a blunt force instrument, like canceling an entire batch [ph]. So while flights may get a little bit delayed, at least they arrive as opposed to what we were doing previously. On the profitability side, we've done so much in terms of putting new products in the market like the ability to upsell to a higher cabin, which gives us -- we'd have more flexibility in how we price that project and the channels that can be purchased in. We've done a lot of improvements in overbooking technology. In a world where there's no change fee, there's a lot more volatility when it comes to cancels, closing cancels and no-shows that we have to have a better overbooking strategy for that. You've heard Vasu mention how important our partnerships are and how we rely on them for revenue generation, where we need to create a much more seamless experience for our customers when they're traveling on us and, for example, JetBlue or Alaska. And finally, you also heard Vasu talk about the loyalty program and how we have used it to really grow our co-brand spend, our enrollments are up, and engagement with the program is really up. So those are just a few of the things that we're doing.\nStephen Trent: That\u2019s very helpful, and let me leave it there, and thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Isom for any closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Well, I'll just -- I'll close with -- pardon me. We're on -- we're going to go to media next. Okay, great. Media next. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now move to media question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question is coming from Alison Sider [Wall Street Journal]. Your line is open.\nAlison Sider: Hi, thanks so much. Just curious if you could share anything if you're seeing any delay disruptions that are tied to not having enough spare parts or engines, if there's any kind of supply chain types of issues you're seeing there?\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Ali. I'll have our Chief Operating Officer, David Seymour, take that one.\nDavid Seymour: I appreciate the question there. Yeah, that's something throughout the pandemic that we've been monitoring very closely working with our large OEM partners throughout to stay ahead of that. And so we've been doing a lot to provide forward look at what our requirements are. So while we know the supply chain systems are tight, we've taken a lot of steps throughout the pandemic to stay ahead of that. And so right now, we're not experiencing those. But again, we know that they're not far away, and we're going to continue to monitor the cost.\nRobert Isom: Yeah. And Ali, I would just say the biggest supply chain issue has been the aircraft manufacturers themselves. We haven't had the, kind of, the delivery certainty that we'd like. So we know that our friends at Boeing and Airbus are working hard to get that back on track.\nAlison Sider: And then I guess just on hiring, do you still have a lot of hiring left to do, or has it shifted more towards just training and getting everyone up to speed and sort of pull up the level of experience?\nRobert Isom: So, hey, Ali, I'll start on this. Look, at American Airlines, I know we have 12,000 more team members in position, but that resulted -- is a result of 20,000 team members that we've had to bring on board and get up to speed. We're behind 2,200 pilots both this year and next year. We've done a great job, I think, in just about every other rank within our team to get the right people on board. So from an American Airlines perspective, we're doing a good job. Of course, we'd like for the regionals to have more supply of new pilots, but we're working hard on that. Over the long run, though, coming to American Airlines is, it's not only a great career, great competition, great benefits. The time to get here is now, because if you ever want to get in and build seniority or take on a new role and lead, it's a good time to come to America.\nAlison Sider: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg. Your line is open.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hey. Thank you. Derek, I wanted to see if you could clarify one thing. You said you have 140 to 150 planes on the ground, but you referred to mainline equivalent aircraft. So can you be a little more specific? You've got 100 regional jets. And then what makes up the rest of that number?\nDerek Kerr: Yes. The mainline equivalent, our mainline aircraft, but what we've done is, instead of pulling aircraft out of the schedule, we lowered the utilization on those aircraft. So if you normally fly 10 hours a day, we now fly 9 hours a day. And if you take that hour across the entire fleet, its equivalent to about 44, 45 aircraft. So we haven't really pulled anything out of the schedule. We've floated. Now as we look forward, I think the right answer is, we pulled down capacity in the third and fourth quarter is to probably take some of those aircraft out and utilize them for spares and for maintenance lines and utilize them to make the reliability better in the airline. So I think as we go forward, we'll do it a little bit differently than we have and not -- and we'll raise the utilization on the rest of the fleet, but take some aircraft out to provide relief for David and his operating team to have more aircraft for maintenance and more aircraft for spares.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. Great. And how long do you expect that conditions in the industry are going to require American to limit its capacity?\nRobert Isom: Well, look, if I knew the answer to that one, really good position. But, hey, look, I think it's dependent on the supply chains, aircraft manufacturers and ultimately, pilot supply to get all back in sync. We're doing our part. And as we've talked, we look at, from a mainline perspective, kind of getting everything back fully utilized over the course of next year or so. And then from a regional perspective, it's just going to take a little bit longer than that, maybe two or three years, to kind of get the supply chain for pilots back to where we need it to be. So that's the way I look at it. Overall, I am confident that everybody is getting back to work, and the variability will hopefully be reduced and the kind of operating performance will improve from where it was even pre-pandemic.\nMary Schlangenstein: Right. And when you refer to supply chains, are you actually talking about physical like assets like supplies that Ali asked about, or are you talking more and predominantly about pilots alone?\nRobert Isom: So well, pilots are one piece. But what I'm speaking of is, Mary, there's not a day that goes by where we don't have issues with provisioning our aircraft with pillows, blankets, plastic cups, food. At various times, we have issues with fueling. It's just -- the concessionaires at the airport. It's just a myriad of things that have to -- that all have to come together to put an aircraft in the air. And yes, the supply chain for aircraft parts is one thing that we monitor closely. But it's all these other things that we really are dependent on so many other parts of the system. And then again, I mentioned our government partners, it's our airport partners, and it's so many others. Aviation touches just a broad swath of the economy. And we need it all to get back to working really well. \nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question is coming from the line of Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News. Your line is open.\nKyle Arnold: Hey, thanks so much. You mentioned the capacity trim in the third and the fourth quarter. Considering that July is almost over and summer travel season has about a month left in it, where are you looking at making those costs? Are they going to be coming after the peak summer demand is over? And what kind of demand, I guess, are you seeing for the fall? And does that play into this capacity cut decisions?\nVasu Raja: Yeah. Hey Kyle, thanks. This is Vasu. So first, a number of the cuts that we talked about have already been loaded into our published schedules that are there. And as we go into fall, effectively, we're going to take capacity in the places where it can create the most operational benefit, which means, one, it can go and turn into the best quality -- the best level of reliability for our customers, and also where we can reaccommodate people the best. So we've minimized a passenger disruption. And then as we go forward into later September, October and deeper into the winter, we have time yet to go and figure out how that goes. There's still a number of things that we're looking at before we make that determination.\nRobert Isom: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Holden Wilen with Dallas Business Journal. Your line is open.\nHolden Wilen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question this morning. I just wanted to, I guess, get your thoughts on elasticity. And if you have any concerns about that going forward, we're seeing fares continue to go up. Do you have any concerns about as shares go up, what effect that might have on elasticity going forward?\nVasu Raja: Hey, thanks for the question. This is Vasu. And no, we don't spend a lot of time worrying about it, just for one simple reason, that what we try to do is create the most value for our customers. And when they like it, they pay us for it. And so, a lot of what you see out there is, there is so much demand that's surging back into travel. As people went through the pandemic, you see and tons of data that consumers create experiences and there's no experience like the experience of travel. And it's bringing a lot of people back, and a lot of people are coming back and doing things for very different reasons than before. And so that's what's really driving things as much as anything. And concepts such as the elasticity of our demand, while it's probably intellectually satisfying to talk about, the reality of it is that consumers really like what they're getting, being able to go and travel the world again, and they're taking advantage of it, and that's turning into relatively higher fares.\nHolden Wilen: Thanks. And then just a sec -- my other question. You talked earlier about the issues at Heathrow. Just curious about maybe if you could talk about where you're sort of at overall from a recovery standpoint within international travel.\nVasu Raja: Yes. I can pick that up, too. So look, this -- the second quarter was very robust. Even though we didn't have all of our -- the wide-bodies that we had planned to take, nonetheless, those that we had performed extremely well, we have -- there's a lot of pent-up demand for people going internationally, wherever that might be, transpacific, transatlantic, and long-haul South America. And we anticipate that, that will continue through the year. Now the summer, the international testing requirement was dropped. And while we saw some benefit of that, it was dropped pretty deep into the booking curve. We anticipate there will be -- that they'll have a much more significant impact on travel demand as we go into the fall and already we're seeing indications of it. And last but not least, short-haul international of Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, has data remains extremely strong for American Airlines, and we anticipate that will be the case going forward.\nHolden Wilen: Thank you, very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question coming from the line of Lori Aratani with Washington Post. Your line is open.\nLori Aratani: Hi. Thank you for taking the time. I wondered if you could go over the hiring numbers again, how many folks you've brought on, how close that gets you to where you want to be. And as a question on that, how much of the staffing issues are hiring versus training?\nRobert Isom: Thanks for that question. Look, our staffing issues are really making sure that we can cover the variability that's in the operations today. We have more people per flight hour, per flight than we have ever had in our company's history on duty. What we're dealing with right now is just a lot of variability in the operating environment. To get to the point where we are now, we've added 12,000 positions, gone out and hired 20,000 people to actually fill those and cover for other attrition. The only shortfall that we have right now is really among our regional pilots. Of course, we're going to do things to make sure that we run the airline as reliably as possible and also take into account more extreme variability in operating conditions. We're doing that by pulling the schedule as we go into the third quarter. But we hope that all the work that we've done puts us in a position where we can restore service, get back up to speed as quickly as possible.\nLori Aratani: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude the media Q&A. I will now turn it back to Mr. Robert Isom for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Thank you so much. And I'll just close with this. I am so proud of our team after fighting through this global pandemic for the last 2.5 years battling every step of the way, persevering, caring for customers and each other every single day. We set a couple of goals. One is to return to profitability and to run the most reliable airline we could. And I am so pleased to report that we have returned to profitability. We intend to stay that way. And I know that our team is intent on making sure that we produce the kind of products that we're all proud of and that our customers want to fly. So thanks for listening in, and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does not cut our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day."}, {"symbol": "AAL", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-21 15:51:05", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the American Airlines Group First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Scott Long.\nScott Long : Thank you, Katherine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call this morning, we have our CEO, Robert Isom; and our CFO, Derek Kerr. Also on the call for the Q&A session are David Seymour, Vasu Raja and a number of other senior executives. Robert will start the call this morning with an overview of the first and our priorities for the year. Derek will follow with the details on the quarter and our operating plans and outlook going forward. After Derek's comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Now before we begin today, I must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecasts of capacity and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. In addition, we'll be discussing several non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information we are giving you on the call morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're going to keep our comments brief this morning. I'm a strong believer that the results speak louder than words, and I'm confident in the results the American Airlines team will produce. Now let's start by thanking our team. Day in and day out, they're on the front line, taking care of our customers no matter what comes our way. And we've certainly seen a lot come our way over the past 2 years. The American Airlines team has worked hard to position us well for the recovery, by simplifying our fleet, modernizing our facilities, fine-tuning our network, developing new partnerships, rolling out new tools for our customers and team and hiring thousands of new team members. All that, while flying the largest airline in the world. I'm excited to see their work pay off for all of our constituents; our customers, certainly; the communities we serve; our team; and notably, our shareholders. It's an honor for me to have the trust of our team and to succeed Doug Parker as CEO and to begin in this position as the industry rebounds and our company returns to profitability. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity. It's a fantastic time for the industry and for American Airlines in particular. For the year ahead, we are resolute in achieving 2 key goals above all else, running a reliable operation and returning to profitability. Our team is up to the challenge, and we've already seen a lot of great progress. So let's talk about financials first. This morning, American reported a first quarter GAAP net loss of $1.6 billion. Excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $1.5 billion for the quarter. Despite the quarterly loss in a difficult January and February due to the effects of Omicron, March results were markedly different. In March, we saw what's possible with surging demand brought on by reduced infection rates, relaxed restrictions and tremendous pent-up demand for people to travel. Despite a sizable increase in the cost of fuel during March, American achieved our first monthly net profit, excluding special items, since July of 2021. Demand is as strong as we've ever seen it. American produced revenues of $8.9 billion in the first quarter, including industry-leading passenger revenues of $7.8 billion. Domestic leisure travel continued to lead the way, far surpassing 2019 levels of traffic and revenue in the month of March. In addition, we saw strong quarter-over-quarter improvement in corporate and government travel with revenue for this segment as a percentage of 2019 increasing 27 percentage points from January to March. System business demand is now about 80% recovered, with small to medium business revenue approaching a full recovery and corporate revenue now around 50% recovered. Corporate bookings are the highest that they've been since the onset of the pandemic, and we expect that to continue as more companies reopen their offices. We anticipate overall business revenue to be around 90% recovered in the second quarter. And finally, demand for international travel also picked up considerably during the quarter as travel restrictions were lifted in certain parts of the world. Long-haul international revenue was around 50% recovered in the first quarter and around 60% recovered in March. So there's still a lot of revenue upside as business and international travel continue to return. The American team has done an incredible job of setting up the airlines to take advantage of the rebound. We're entering our network to where our customers want to fly, establishing partnerships in more challenging areas and making sure efficiency is top of mind. As a result, we're very optimistic about the continued recovery and expect to be profitable in the second quarter based on current demand trends and fuel price forecast. Turning to reliability. American ended 2021 with our strongest operating performance in the company's history. We're committed to maintaining that momentum in the first quarter, and we did. Despite 2 difficult winter storms in Dallas-Fort, the team delivered a solid operating performance in the first quarter, leading the industry in on-time departures and finishing a close second at on-time arrivals. And they did so while flying a considerably larger schedule than our next largest competitor. More importantly, for the month of March, the mid-peak best-ever combined March completion factor. Our operation in DFW and Charlotte, our 2 largest hubs, met or exceeded our expectations and delivered their best on-time performance and completion factor in years. As a result of our team's hard work, our likelihood to recommend scores continue to track in line with plan and are near the top of our post-merger performance. Running a reliable operation this summer will be critical to the continued recovery, and we have taken numerous steps to ensure we are well prepared to deliver for our customers. Our summer planning began last year as demand returned, and we haven't slowed down. American has 12,000 more team members in place to support the operation this summer than in the summer of 2021. We've already welcomed more than 600 new pilots this year, exceeding our goal. And we will continue to aggressively recruit, hire and train across all departments to develop the best pipeline of talent in the industry. We're ready for the summer, and we have sized the airline for the resources we have available. Again, we sized the airline for the resources that we have available. We've also made targeted investments in people, technology and resources that are yielding promising results for our team members and customers. So before I hand it over to Derek, I want to say that I'm really excited about the future of our industry and the future of American Airlines. There's still a lot of revenue upside going forward, given industry revenues are still off from their historical relationship to GDP, barriers to demand are falling, and business and international trends are promising. There are also certain industry constraints on growth in the near term, notably related to pilot and aircraft supply. And at American, we have completed a $1.3 billion cost reduction program. And our unit cost performance will improve throughout the year as utilization approaches historic levels. No airline is better positioned to operate in this environment than American Airlines because of our fleet, our network and everything our team has accomplished over the past 2 years. And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the results, I want to acknowledge Doug for his more than 20 years as an airline CEO. Doug's leadership revolutionized the industry and laid the foundation for American success going forward. I also want to thank the American Airlines team. Their hard work and commitment to our customers and each other is truly extraordinary. This morning, we reported a first quarter GAAP net loss of $1.6 billion, or a loss of $2.52 per share. Excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $1.5 billion or a loss of $2.32 per share. Revenue in the first quarter outperformed the initial expectations we outlined on our last call, despite flying less capacity than planned due to winter weather events that affected our largest hubs. Our first quarter revenue recovered to 84% compared to the same period in 2019 versus our original guide of 78% to 80% recovery. Demand recovery from the Omicron variant was swift. And while leisure demand remains very strong, as more companies return to their offices, business demand is growing quickly. On the cost side, in addition to the efficiencies we've spoken about previously, we remain focused on keeping our controllable costs down, ensuring we are a more efficient airline as we return to normalized levels of capacity and utilization. In fact, in the face of increased fuel prices, we were profitable for the month of March, excluding net special items, due to our strong revenue performance and cost efficiencies. Our fleet remains the youngest and most fuel-efficient among the U.S. global network carriers. This month, we completed our narrow-body fleet harmonization project. It covers more than 500 aircraft, and will ensure a consistent product and better experience for customers, along with the improved revenue generation and unit cost production associated with the new seating configurations. In the first quarter, we took delivery of 9 Airbus 321neos and reactivated 7 previously stored Boeing 737-800s. We also inducted 8 dual-class regional aircraft and parked three 50-seat Embraer 145s. As previously disclosed, we made several updates to our fleet order book and the timing of future deliveries, allowing us to better meet the demand strength in domestic and short-haul international markets. We previously announced our plans to exercise purchase options on 30 737 MAX-8s. 15 of these options are scheduled for delivery in 2023 and 15 in 2024. Additionally, with the continued uncertainty associated with our 787 deliveries, we are now planning for the delivery of only seven 788 in 2022, all after our summer schedule, with the remaining six 788 aircraft being delivered in 2023. The four 789 aircraft previously planned in late 2023 are now planned to be delivered in 2024. With these changes, our expected total aircraft CapEx is $1.8 billion in 2022 and $2.2 billion in '23. We ended the first quarter with $15.5 billion of total available liquidity, significantly higher than our initial forecast due to ATL build of $2.3 billion in the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion and free cash flow of more than $350 million in the first quarter. Deleveraging our balance sheet remains a top priority, and we are committed to significant debt reduction in the years ahead. Even in this volatile environment, we remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025. During the quarter, we made $344 million in scheduled debt payments and completed $317 million in open market repurchases of our $750 million unsecured senior notes maturing in June. To date, we have reduced our overall debt levels by $4.1 billion from our peak levels in the second quarter of 2021. We expect to make $1 billion of scheduled debt payments in the second quarter, which includes the remaining outstanding balance of the unsecured senior notes. Lastly, with cost-efficient financing secured for all aircraft deliveries through the third quarter of this year, we are now beginning to evaluate financing options for the fourth quarter and first half of 2023. As we look at the second quarter, we expect to be profitable despite the expectation of continued elevated fuel prices. Pre-tax margins are expected to be between 3% and 5% for the quarter based on the current demand trends and our fuel price forecast. Based on current demand assumptions, we expect total revenue to be 6% to 8% higher versus the second quarter of 2019 on 6% to 8% lower capacity. That would be the first time we have produced total revenue greater than 2019 since the start of the pandemic. In fact, if we hit the midpoint of this revenue guide, the results would be the highest quarterly revenue in the company's history. On this revenue strength, we expect total revenue per available seat mile to be 14% to 16% higher in the second quarter versus the same period of 2019. We expect our second quarter CASM, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 8% and 10%. Our current forecast for the second quarter, which we pegged on Tuesday, assumes fuel between $3.59 and $3.64 per gallon, an increase of more than 60% versus the price of fuel in the second quarter of 2019. In the near term, the demand environment is strong, but margins are lower than they otherwise would have been given the recent run-up in fuel. Longer term, this industry has proven that it has the ability to recapture increases in the cost of fuel and be profitable at elevated fuel prices. We believe this time is no different. As for full year 2022 capacity, we now expect to be recovered to 92% to 94% of 2019 levels. The reduction in full year capacity from our prior guide is largely due to 788 delivery delays that I touched on earlier. This capacity guidance is, of course, subject to future demand environment and fuel prices. Consequently, with this lower level of capacity, we now expect our full year CASM, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 8% and 10% versus 2019. In conclusion, with the actions we have taken and the commitment of our team, we remain very well positioned. We remain focused on running a reliable operation and returning to profitability, which we expect to happen in the second quarter. With that, we'll open up the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: I guess you're starting in the order of sort of the biggest second quarter miss. So, great. So listen, we're all\u2026\nRobert Isom : Not quite, but close, Jamie. Not quite but close.\nJamie Baker: All right. So we're familiar with that relationship between airline revenue and GDP. You brought it up. Doug had a good slide on -- in his deck last month. Have you looked at the relationship between leisure demand and GDP? And what that relationship might be telling us? I know we could try to back into this with some of the Form 41 data, but I don't really trust it. There's a reporting lag. It just doesn't tell me anything.\nRobert Isom: Hey, Jamie, thanks. I'm going to let Vasu answer that. But hey, don't feel bad. This is a long game. We know you're going to get it right over the long term. So\u2026\nJamie Baker : Thanks for the endorsement.\nVasu Raja: Yes. Jamie, thanks for the question. And it's a very good one, one that we've actually spent a lot of time thinking about. And what I'll say is, you're right. In aggregate, like historical relationship between airline demand and GDP, let's call it industry demand, at something around just under 1% of GDP, does largely seem to hold. And we're seeing that as things start to recover. We spent a lot of time on this question about, what is the actual trip purpose and how does that change? And the reality is it's changing in a meaningful enough way where we no longer think it's pretty at the start of a trend. For example, historically, only about 20% to 25% of the trips in the airline were something that we call blended, where somebody was traveling for both business and leisure. Now for about 5 to 6 months, about 50% to 55% of the trips in the airline are blended. And as we look forward into the coming months, that continues to be the case. And that's playing out in a lot of different ways for us, which are both opportunities and a little bit unprecedented, right? We are seeing different sales days becoming big sales days. Different travel days becoming big travel days. So the nature of what we call leisure demand and business demand is changing. And the first thing is better understanding exactly how that is. But so far, it's been promising. Those blended trips that we have in the system are coming in at yields that are 75% to 85% of what were true business-only trips, but they're coming through lower comp sales channels and off of negotiated discount. So the net yields of them are very often the best things in the system. So this is an evolving thing and one that we'll keep coming back to you. But the relationship is indeed changing, as you say, even though in aggregate, a lot of the trends won't.\nJamie Baker : And just out of curiosity, how do you define or how do you tell that a trip is a blended trip? Is it somebody booking with a corporate discount and then bringing a family member on an adjacent PNR? Like how do you know that?\nVasu Raja: Yes. So over the years of viewing this thing, we actually come out in 2 ways. One, we have a lot of models that go and actually predict whether the behavior is business or leisure. And we survey customers to go and calibrate the model. So over time, we are really good. So whatever we -- you hear us talk about business, we are talking about, for example, somebody who travels, one person on the itinerary, no checked bags, things like that, right? If it's a profile, and we calibrate against surveys of what the customer actually tells us. And so one of the things that we found is that increasingly, those surveys are starting to change because people are saying they're flying both for business and leisure or it's one person in the itinerary, but they're leaving on Thursday, coming back on a Monday and going to Pensacola. So a lot of things are starting to change, and that's actually a pretty promising thing.\nJamie Baker : Yes. Fascinating. And then second, and maybe for Robert, as we think about the steps that you're taking to protect the operation, heading into the summer peak, is the zero still the metric that American tends to focus on? I think it was in the past. The sense I got was that it wasn't hugely popular with the entirety of the airport staff. Just wondering if with your background, Robert, and having ascended to the top seat, is that still the metric that you have prioritized, let's say?\nRobert Isom : Jamie, I'm going to start with this, which is the outcome in on-time arrival we know is the biggest driver of customer satisfaction. As I've said before, it makes the food taste better. It seems more comfortable. Service more friendly, all that. And the best way to ensure an on-time arrival is to make sure you depart on time. So there's no stepping away from it. But I'll tell you, we have evolved over time. And we really do want to take into account making sure that the things that we do to get an aircraft out on time don't compromise other aspects of the operation. So couldn't congestion on the ramp. Or if we do have inclement weather, at the end of the day, if we have flights that you may be able to get out on time, but you ought to hold for connecting passengers, we do so. And so we could go into a lot more detail on that. But the answer to it all is, for the bulk of the airline, get it started right. No aircraft out of service in the morning, on-time departure, a fast turn and stay that way throughout the day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon : We are into the other end of the spectrum, I guess. Could you talk a little bit about what you have in the forecast for business travel recovery as we think about the summer months? What are you seeing in the booking trends? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of what the mix is within the guidance that you're giving us.\nVasu Raja: David, this is Vasu. I can help with that. For Robert's comments at the beginning, as we closed the quarter, system business revenues were about 80% recovered versus 2019. As we look at Q2, we anticipate that number will be about 90% recovered versus 2019. We have a level of confidence in it because, indeed, we're seeing many of those bookings start to come in from my comments that Jamie just now. But also, the gap between 90 and 100 is really largely due to long-haul international demand and certain pockets of domestic demand. But we are continuing to see demand come in.\nDavid Vernon : Okay. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. I remember having a conversation with Doug and Derek in LA a couple of years ago now, around denied boarding sort of involuntary denials, that kind of stuff. And you guys have been working on some technology to help you guys reaccommodate customers work on this issue of not having enough seats on the plane over selling that kind of stuff. Is there any early indication during this period of demand here that those efforts are paying off and the denied boardings are coming in a little bit in line with those expectations you set out a couple of years ago?\nRobert Isom : David, we're going to start with Maya Leibman talking about some of the things we've done and if there's some add-on to that, Vasu will do it.\nMaya Leibman : Hey, David, this is Maya. Yes. Over the last several years, we've really improved our technology around essentially pre-removing customers. So either before they get to the airport several days before they fly if we know that flight is at the risk of overselling providing them an opportunity to bid or to either take compensation or even just move to a different place that's probably a little bit better than the flight that they were previously scheduled on. Or if it happens that there's a last-minute schedule change, a last-minute equipment change, so we have to deal with it at the airport, which isn't our goal. We're really trying to deal with it before they get to the airport. We have some pretty neat auction capabilities that allow the customer better opportunities to move around to other flights. And so all of those things together have really helped improve our denied boarding statistics.\nVasu Raja: Yes. I'll only add to that. Throughout the pandemic, one of the hardest things to do, to predict has been the show rate of the airline. Understandably as the pandemic wear on, we would have periods of time where everybody showed for a flight in periods of time where the show rate could be as low as 70% of what was booked. What we're encouraged by, in large part because of a lot of the technologies that we've got not just in managing overbooking, but it's typically just forecasting show rate, we are getting to a place where we are a lot better at going and predicting what the variability is. And with the technologies that we've got proactively moving customers off so that we don't have the same level of denied boarding expense that we had in times past. And indeed, we're able to generate more revenue through the overbooking flights.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth : I was wondering, maybe, Vasu, could you provide a little bit of color on what you're seeing across the -- on the long-haul side across the different entities?\nVasu Raja: Sure, Savi. Yes, thanks for the question. Look, we're really encouraged with how long-haul demand has come back, but it is indeed very different across the 3 long-haul entities of long-haul South America, Transatlantic and Transpacific. First, we are encouraged because indeed we've seen bookings from maybe post-Omicron low point in January, what we're seeing in the last 4 to 6 weeks, it's improved by several factors. In South America, that's a factor of 2x to 3x. In Transatlantic, it's something materially larger than that. And in Transpacific, it's grown quite a lot, too, but still, the bookings are pretty small and insignificant in the totality of all of our bookings. But what we're really encouraged by is the manner in which demand is returning first in long-haul South America, where we just -- where we have so much capacity. Increasingly, we're seeing not just more customers simply sign on for flights, but we're filling premium cabins at a better and better rate. The same is true in Transatlantic, where so much of the airline that we brought back there is centered around our partner hubs, in Heathrow and Madrid. And we're encouraged because those are -- to make those slight go, they are very premium demand consumptive and we are seeing a lot of premium demand, even though we aren't seeing large corporate travel quite come back into international the way we've seen before. And as at Transpacific, it's understandably challenged because as long as there are entry restrictions, demand remains pretty stubborn to come back. But -- like I said, we're encouraged that once those restrictions are lifted, the demand improves pretty meaningfully.\nSavanthi Syth: That's super helpful. And if I might ask, Derek, just a quick question on the fuel. Is your kind of fuel contracts based on kind of the forward curve than crack spreads? I think there's -- or like spot prices, I mean? I think there's a little bit of confusion on what we're seeing on spot, and this is not unique to American, but what's being reflected in fuel guidance is.\nDerek Kerr : Yes. No, that's exactly -- we just pegged it 2 days ago. So at -- it was 107. And then we used the crack spread and where that was, and the crack spread had increased a little bit. So the difference may be crack spread and then the dates that everybody takes the fuel pay, but we're straight off of the fuel curve and then it's dependent on where are you buying your fuel. Are you buying your fuel more in the Gulf Coast, L.A., New York? So there could be differences between each airline just where the brunt of the fuel comes from.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker : Just two questions. One is on minimum liquidity. Derek, have you thought about where you want that to go, other than get -- I think you said, what, pay down $15 billion of debt by 2026? And then the other question is, I think, related to the pilot training pipeline. You talk about a shortage of crew members and limits to capacity growth, so how are you thinking about catching up?\nDerek Kerr : Yes. I can do both, and Robert can add to some of that. So as far as minimum liquidity, we're still in the same place as we were a couple of calls ago. We're at about $15.5 billion right now. We are seeing this recovery. We'd like to see it actually be in the actuals. So I think this is a forward guide, which we think is where we're going to get and be profitable for the quarter. If we maintain this level, what we have said is we would take a step down to somewhere in the $10 billion to $12 billion range. And hopefully, that happens sometime this year, which can accelerate the debt pay down. And any further than that, we just haven't had the discussions through the Board and through the committees. We ran the company at $7 billion of not minimum liquidity, which I defined -- that was kind of our targeted cash level. Minimum liquidity is actually much lower than that. But our targeted cash level was at $7 billion. And so right now, we're holding out of the cash. And when we see the recovery, and it's holding up and the cash is holding up, we will use that cash to pay down debt. And I think we'll take it down to some in there, we're in the $10 billion to $12 billion range as we look forward. On the pilot training pipeline, as Robert said, we've hired 600 pilots at the mainline. So it's -- it really is -- we have the pilots. I think the industry is -- it's about trying to hire 2,000 pilots this year versus the most we've ever hired in the past is 1,000. So we have the simulators coming in. We have the trainers coming in. So what it is, is trying to get everybody through the pipeline. And I think we will be fully utilized in how all of our aircraft flying by the end of the year. The other side of it is the regional carriers, which we're working on, is that hiring is going well also. So we're hiring there. Just the attrition is much greater than the hiring at this point in time. We're getting people through the pipeline. That has slowed, which is good. So as all the mainline carriers have hired from the regional carriers, we all have a backlog to get through training. So the regional attrition has slowed, which will be good for regional capacity as we go forward. But we believe that by the end of the year or through the summer, we'll be back up and having all the airline aircraft flying, which will be great for us from a utilization perspective. It will be great for us from a cost perspective to drive down the unit cost as we bring back all of those aircraft and get the pilot pipeline moving through.\nRobert Isom : Well said that. And the only thing other -- Helane, the only other point that I would add is that, look, over time, it's supply and demand. And I'm confident that the quality of life and the compensation for pilots is something that's going to attract a lot of people to the industry. It may take some time to work through, but it will happen.\nHelane Becker : Right. Could you, in the short term, bring back pilots who might have retired at, say, 58 or 60, and just have them work for a couple of years to bridge the gap? Or once they retire, that's that?\nRobert Isom : I'm going to ask David Seymour, our Chief Operating Officer, to weigh in on that.\nDavid Seymour: Yes. I think the challenge with that is many of them have been retired long enough that they would have to go through a requalification, which would take one of those slots. So given that, as Derek talked about, we have the supply coming in, and the school house is really running at full speed here. And we're hitting the objectives that we set forward to reach the goals that Derek talked about for the remainder of the year. So as much -- I think that would be a great idea, and we just take away a slot for a new hire that's coming in.\nRobert Isom : And look, overall as well, we have a great relationship with the APA and making sure that we're getting as many pilots onboard and creating as many captain positions as we possibly can. And anything that would alter something like retirement status would have to be something that they champion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg : Just two here. I guess my first to Vasu. Vasu, historically, I guess, sort of the rule of thumb is that the run-up in energy prices usually sort of finds its way into the fare structure with like a lag of 3 to 6 months. It does feel like that it's getting recaptured far more quickly. And I just wonder if it's any sort of structural changes and/or just by approaching this fuel price cycle with a bit less capacity, which may give you some leverage in your ability to quickly offset that? Just your thoughts around that?\nVasu Raja: Yes, Mike, it's an excellent question. And it looks like Jamie is one that we've actually spent a lot of time understandably thinking about. Look, it's really hard to tease out the different effects because you're right, there's high fuel prices. There's various limits on capacity as airlines try to size their airlines for the staffing that they can produce. And of course, demand, which just continues to accelerate at a pretty unprecedented rate. So look, we look at are actually the fares that we, American Airlines are out selling. And we're encouraged that indeed, month-to-month, we are seeing a greater increase in fares than certainly what we saw in 2019. But very importantly, one of the things that we've been looking at is how fare is at large -- or how is the rate of increase actually changing in 2019 to 2022 versus the last time the industry went through so many cataclysmic crisis, which were big fuel, The Great Recession, changes in the industry through consolidation? And indeed, the rate -- the pace of change that we're seeing is growing much greater than what we saw before. Short way to say it is, we are seeing a lot of strength in the fare environment with customers who frankly value quality of product that we have and are willing to pay us to fly. So we're encouraged by that. We see those trends going forward into the summer. And of course, that's inherent in the revenue guide you see before you.\nMike Linenberg : Great. And then just my second, with respect to the NEA and I guess, the Justice's concern about potential consumer harm, have you put out any numbers about you have done from a consumer benefit perspective since it's now been up and running, I think, for some time? Or is that something that we just won't find out about until September?\nVasu Raja: I can start and others can add. Well, look, we can't talk about the consumer benefits of the NEA enough. And indeed you can already see it and just what's published out there. In the first quarter, we brought the Northeast back faster than any of our competition. And arguably through bringing it back, has encouraged competition where they frankly wasn't any before. We're doing things like we have full flat beds on all of our Transcon markets, which is a thing that American Airlines is -- has long dreamed of now through this partnership with JetBlue we're able to make happen. We brought JetBlue into LaGuardia, I think, which they long to make happen, putting a new level of price competition on the incumbent carrier there. And so we're encouraged by the structural things that's there, but what we're really encouraged by is the way consumers are responding to it. So right now, for the first time and as long as we've recorded it, advantage enrollments, our loyalty program enrollments are growing in New York and Boston at greater rates than anything in the system as an absolute size, which is greater than anything at the system. New York is on a percentage of 2019, we're acquiring more credit card customers there than we did in 2019 and at a greater rate than any other parts of our system. So all of which is to say that the consumer is clearly responding to it and we see those benefits, and we keep rolling things out. We -- there's a lot that we've kind of worked through as we kind of try to staff up a connecting operation at JFK, we've endeavored to go slow in order to make it happen. I hope for a minute say that we are all the way to achieving what we want there to be, but we are really encouraged by what it's doing for consumers, the level of competition that it's bringing. And indeed, I mean, we can't talk about it enough, and maybe we need to talk about it more.\nRobert Isom : Vasu, I'll just add, and I know our Chief Legal Officer, Priya Aiyar, will agree with me. Look, we welcome scrutiny. We know that this is producing the benefits we said it would. And it's doing exactly what we had hoped. And we're confident we're going to prevail no matter what we face going forward. [Pretty good with that?]\nVasu Raja: Absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.\nDan McKenzie : A couple of questions here. First, a clarification to guide, maybe for Vasu. What level of restoration in international flying does the revenue guide embeds? So does it include the relaxation of the 24-hour testing requirement in May sometime? And what conversations is the government having with you about the travel restrictions internationally?\nRobert Isom : So Vasu, you can handle that first part. And let's have Nate cover -- pull data on testing.\nVasu Raja: Yes, Dan, thanks for the question. And look, we -- international at large, we broadly anticipated to be 100% recovered. And indeed, it's not far from that right now. But to the question earlier from Savi, international is in a lot of different states of play right now. Never forget, for us, in the second quarter, roughly 90% of our airline is flying in the Western Hemisphere and Heathrow. So a lot of our recovery is due to the fact that our short-haul international network is recovering at rates that are probably greater than what we see in domestic. And those markets such as London and long-haul South America, are recovering pretty quickly, too. I mean that's where we have all of our capacity.\nRobert Isom : As just one note there. International revenue, not 100% recovered. Go ahead -- from a long-haul perspective.\nVasu Raja: Correct Yes, correct. So yes, I would say that the long-haul revenue isn't all the way there, but total international is, and that's...\nRobert Isom: Exactly.\nNate Gatten: Yes. And this is Nate. I would just say on the regulatory side, obviously, the testing is something that we continue to engage on with our industry partners. We believe that the U.S. can safely follow countries that are progressing through the pandemic, including Canada, the UK and Ireland, which have, we think, safely evolved the scope of their entry requirements and moved away from predeparture testing. We've learned by this point in the pandemic, however, not to speculate on what may or may not happen. So we don't have a specific timeframe in mind. It's just something we continue to work on. Obviously, the decision is going to be up to the Federal authorities and public health experts.\nRobert Isom: Okay. And for everybody, that's Nate Gatten, our Head of Corporate and Government Affairs. So thanks, Nate.\nDan McKenzie : Yes. Thank Second question here. Looking at Slide 5, the simple math is it looks like there's roughly $7 billion of revenue that was missing on an annualized basis relative to the first quarter. But I believe the headcount is already in place. So we're left with variable cost, I think so. But if you could flesh this out, the fixed versus variable costs as you add back some of this higher-margin international flying?\nDerek Kerr: Dan, this is Derek. As we have talked about, we have the airline and costs in place to run a much greater airline. So as we go and as Robert said in his comments, our CASM will get better and better throughout the year as we add back to flying. An example is our salaries, I think, stay pretty flat throughout the year, even though we're growing ASMs throughout the year. So most everything is in place to fly. The example is the 787s. We thought we had the 787s coming in beginning of this year. So we have the pilots. We have the crews. We have everything ready to go. We're not going to train them back down to 7-3s or other aircraft. We're going to leave them there for when they come. So our expectation as we move forward and we bring back the aircraft and utilize our fleet and get us back to 100% of 2019, it comes at a significant reduction in the CASM calculation as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Congrats, Robert, on the formal handoff. I wanted to follow-up to Mike's question. Just with respect to JetBlue's bid for Spirit, as it relates to the NEA, Do you see any relationship between the 2 initiatives? And what is American's perspective on the proposed acquisition?\nRobert Isom : Steve, do you want to comment here?\nSteve Johnson: Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Steve Johnson. First, I think it's important to recognize that JetBlue's acquisition of Spirit is not a foregone conclusion. Those -- JetBlue and Spirit is near, as we can tell, are discussing that now. And we'll ultimately find out which direction that's going to go. But I would say that Joanna and Robin were very quick to call Robert as soon as the story leaked. And they were steadfast in their view that NEA was extraordinarily important to the priority to JetBlue and that they intended to do everything that they could to maintain it. And that part of their bid for Spirit contemplated keeping and even strengthening the NEA.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Thanks for that perspective. With respect to the RASM guidance, Vasu, can you just contrast for us maybe how leisure fares are tracking versus 2019 versus closing business fares? And I understand regions, et cetera, make that more complicated. But maybe if we just look at it on a cut per say, domestic, is the closing 0 to 3 getting better yet relative to '19?\nVasu Raja: Yes. Thanks for the question. And indeed, one that we look at very closely, because it is kind of interesting. We look at it both and what is out there selling, but importantly, what is netted back to us after we deduct the cost of sale from it. And so we are seeing, first and foremost, that -- we look at it really outside 14 versus inside 14. Outside of 14, indeed, there is a significant level of fare strength across any competitive O&D grouping there might be. Inside of 14, we see the same level of fare strength. But as we look at it right now, leisure trips or blended business leisure trips are coming in at yield levels that are anywhere from 75% to 80% in aggregate of what inside 14 corporate negotiated trips are coming in at. And that's a really meaningful number because that means on a net basis, sometimes these fares which are coming to us oftentimes through our direct channels, through some pretty unprecedented sources on a net basis are actually really, really valuable to us and really valuable carbon departure. The fares are high. What we are encouraged by is as we have rolled through March, there's simply more demand inside of 14 and more business and business and leisure demand. So yes, we see a lot of strength in the fare environment, a lot more strength outside of 14, but progressively greater strength and greater demand inside of 14.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I guess maybe just to put a finer point on it. Do you think 0 to 3 is still an opportunity? And thank you for taking the question.\nVasu Raja: Yes, it is but not in quite the same way that it was before.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien : So maybe just one on the 787. When we think about your CapEx over the next couple of years, as the 787 rules into future years, should we just be thinking about rolling forward that associated CapEx? Are we reaching a point where we should be thinking about maybe some late penalties potentially lowering your overall CapEx profile as we look across the next couple of years on an aggregated basis? I think you might have mentioned that Boeing was already paying penalties to prior years. Just trying to get a sense to the read-through to American free cash flow in future years.\nDerek Kerr : Yes. Catherine, I would -- just from a CapEx perspective, I would just roll it without a doubt. Any kind of settlement that we have will be separate. The Boeing management team have assured us that they will cover us for the damages on the 787s -- the deliveries with the 787s. How that comes? I don't know, because we haven't talked about it. There's no reason to discuss damages on the 787s until they deliver and we know when those are going to be, so that can be calculated. So in the models today, I would move the CapEx and just shove out the CapEx. But I would -- there is upside to the cash flow or something for a settlement with the Boeing team. As they've said, they will cover the damages that we are incurring for those aircraft to be delayed and deferred.\nCatherine O'Brien : Okay. Got it. And then maybe one for Vasu, just coming a little bigger picture here. Can you just update us on the hub strategy you're working through pre-pandemic? You growth opportunities at DFW, Charlotte, D.C., as you add back capacity, are you adding proportionately more flying into those hubs than you had in 2019? Or do you need to first restore the pre-pandemic network overall and then you look to those growth opportunities? Just trying to get a sense of -- I know those are the most profitable hubs. So are we already starting to blend in that higher proportion of more profitable flying? Or is that on the comp?\nVasu Raja: It's a great question. Yes, we are absolutely blending it in now. As we said through the pandemic, we had no intention of wasting the crisis, and we didn't. We massively simplified the fleet reduce, frankly, a number of long-haul airplanes that were amongst defining some of our most unprofitable route. Launched new partnerships where we can create more value for the customer, offer more network in places like the West Coast and New York where we're weaker. But very importantly, we've put a lot more capacity into our hubs in 2 ways. One, we've concentrated more flying there, but we've updated the airline as well. We're 8% more seats per departure than as we go forward than what we were at the same time last year. But for us, like the changes are indeed quite meaningful. Right now, if you go look and published schedules, about 65%, 70% of the airlines flying really what we call our Sunbelt hubs and short-haul Caribbean kind of markets, where the airline has a unique level of strength. And just -- to put that in perspective, I was reading through everyone's print last night, that in Q1, our 4 Sunbelt hubs, DFW, Charlotte, Miami, Phoenix, were somewhere between 70% to 80% of our competitors' full network, but are producing unit revenues between 5% to 10% greater than those networks. So very much that is a major thing, a big part, as we talked about here, of returning to profitability. And frankly, running a better operation is focusing hard in those markets where we create really unique and disproportionate value and really getting all of our assets working there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham: I know United and Delta have talked to generating a profit for -- in 2022, just given where demand is. I realized you guys have stopped short of saying that today, but the question that we're getting is just around the sustainability of like RASM production. So do you expect to generate a profit for the remaining 3 quarters of this year, assuming like no massive change in oil or anything like that?\nRobert Isom: Conor, I'll start. Derek can add into this. Look, we're really pleased to be here talking about record revenues and producing a profit in the second quarter. But those are forecast. You know what our job here is to make those forecasts a reality. So we're going to get to that business. And fourth, to achieve profitability for the year, I get I guarantee it, we need to be profitable in the second quarter. And we're going to get started on that, and we'll update you as time goes on. Derek, anything else you want to add?\nDerek Kerr: Agree.\nConor Cunningham : Okay. Okay. And I know you said you've sized the airlines and the resources you have, but there has been some struggles with operations, demand surge last year. Do you assume any incentive pay above and beyond what you've historically contemplated in your 2022 CASM outlook? And have you viewed incentive pay any differently than you have in the past, just given some of the staffing issues the industry has faced, in general?\nRobert Isom : Conor, thanks for that. But I'll start with this is that just like the rest of the world, we're all getting back up to speed. Firstly, for American, we did what the government asked us to when they provide us with the payroll support program. We ran the airline, and we ran it to serve people that had to get to business and leisure activities and you name it. As we go forward, the jump that we have to take -- to get to the kind of capacity that Derek has mentioned in our forecast, it's not that sizable of a jump. We're way ahead of it. We've certainly learned from issues. We're really focused on other parts of what I consider the airline supply chain, and that's our partners. But we're very well compared. We have 12,000 more team members on all ready to fly the spring and summer schedule, I feel really great about it and very, very confident that we're going to fly a reliable airline as we did, and we proved over the year-end holidays, better than a lot of our competition and as we have in the first 3 months of this year, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: First of all, for Derek, just to confirm the updated CASM outlook that does not include any new labor deals. And then just kind of a follow-up to that, given the labor market and your operational plans, where do you think kind of CASM eventually shakes out relative to 2019 once all is set and done?\nDerek Kerr : Yes. One is, yes, the -- our CASM guidance is not having any new labor deals in it. We're in negotiations with a lot of our unions at this point in time, but we don't -- but we'll put those in a CASM guide when they occur and when we know where those are, but that's not in the CASM guide for the rest of the year. Getting back to 2019 levels depends on going back and when do we grow back fully from a capacity perspective. And also, as you alluded to, when do those labor deals go into effect? In 2019, we did the mechanic deal and we completed the mechanic deal during 2019. So that year-over-year is now into our numbers. So I think as we grow the airline back, getting ourselves back to 2019 CASM levels will take us to get our utilization back to where it was before and get all the aircraft back flying to get closer to that 2019 level.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And then Vasu, I fully appreciate the historical relationship with GDP in response to one of the earlier questions. I guess, we get a lot of investor questions on inflation and the health of the consumer. Do you have any historical perspective on consumer demand at these levels of inflation? And at what point to anticipate some sort of consumer slowing, if at all, in this type of environment?\nVasu Raja: Yes, it's an excellent question. And -- there's a lot that we're seeing today, which is kind of breaking from a lot of historical trends, much like the question earlier about how fuel prices are bleeding in the fare. It's -- right now, it's really difficult to tease out what is causing what. But yes, as an industry, there hasn't been a great history of how inflation has turned changes in demand. But we're so far encouraged by what we see right now in 2 ways. First, demand continues to grow and grow at a meaningful pace. How long-lasting it is remains to be seen. But if we learn anything in the last 20 to 24 months, we can adjust just about anything and do it pretty quickly. And the other thing which is really encouraging is, frankly, spending on our co-branded credit cards. That is one where the -- throughout the pandemic, even though airline revenues fell, our co-branded revenues never felt nearly to the same degree. And indeed, we're encouraged right now because there our acquisitions are higher than before, and our spend on the card is keeping pace with inflation. Indeed, on our card with Barclays, our spend is growing at a greater rate than inflation. So we are encouraged by that. There's clearly a level of demand for our product and future anticipation of travel, which is very promising. And we'll see how it plays out.\nOperator: And that's all the time we have for analysts. We open the queue for your media. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: I'm just curious what you're seeing -- any response to COVID starting to rise again? Are you seeing that reflected at all in consumer demand? Or in sort of your staffing, are you seeing higher rates of absences? And is that something you're kind of planning around?\nRobert Isom : Hey, Al. It's Robert. The answer to both is no.\nAlison Sider : Okay. And I just had a couple on the masks. I guess, in a couple of days since that policy has changed. Have you seen any evidence of any kind of shift in bookings, increased bookings or decreased? Is there any evidence yet that, that there will be any change to demand as a result of the mask mandates being lifted?\nVasu Raja: Hey, Al, this is Vasu. It's still very early to tell and really difficult to draw very much of a conclusion. But so far, there's nothing to indicate that it's materially up or materially down.\nAlison Sider : Okay. So not like when other international travel restrictions get lifted and there's an immediate response?\nVasu Raja: Just certainly not on that order of magnitude at all.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Koenig with Associated Press.\nDavid Koenig : Robert and Derek both addressed this on the pilot. You gave pilot figures for pilot hires. I was looking for a net number. Is 600 enough to offset the age 65 retirements and other attrition? What's the net number? And bottom line, are you going to have enough pilots to fly this summer?\nRobert Isom : Let me start, and David Seymour can join in. The answer is yes. As I've said repeatedly, we're sizing the airline for the resources that we have. From a pilot perspective, all of this hiring is meant to match up to a schedule, but also a schedule that we are making sure that we've built and safety factors. So we have tremendous confidence that we can fly. In addition to that, we're scheduling the airline, employing tools that are different than we had before. And my confidence only grows, as I -- as we make our way in the year. David, do you have anything else to add?\nDavid Seymour: Robert, let me just add to that. I mean, I think the numbers Derek talked about the 600, that was this year alone. So last year, we had a target of hiring 350, we hired over 500. So the 600 is just for this year, and that's well ahead of pace where we set our expectations to. In the pilot training right now, we're actually getting our goals and our throughput that we expect and don't foresee any problems going forward of making those numbers so we can hit the goal to fly all of our aircraft by the end of this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein : I had a couple of quick questions. One, Robert, you had said this morning, I think, that you're not doing as much regional flying as you would like to be. And I wanted to see if you could comment in terms of have you got planes parked? Have you suspended any routes? And is that all related to the shortage of pilots on the regional level?\nRobert Isom : Yes. So thanks, Mary. As Derek noted, we're not find the full regional schedule we'd like to. We're going to get those aircraft back up over time. But it's related to how they're being hired from the regional airlines, so an increased level of attrition and the time it takes to actually backfill those pilots. So while the regional carriers are able to source pilots at this time, we just can't get them up to speed and in the position fast enough. Over the long term, we do need to work on regional pilot supply. And we're out in front of that with our cadet program and trying to incentive people to come into the business. And I know -- I'm confident that, over the long term, the prospects of quality of life and compensation are something that are going to attract people to the business.  So it may take some time to work out. But as Derek said, over the course of the next year or so, we anticipate being able to get not only mainline back up to full utilization by the end of the year, the regionals sometime thereafter.\nMary Schlangenstein : How much down is you're flying, your regional flying?\nDerek Kerr : Departures in the second quarter are probably down about 20% versus 2019, where the airline mainline is down about 5%. So maybe 15% different than lower than what the mainline is.\nRobert Isom : And Mary, I want to note on that. We're not just -- look, while we have aircraft that we're not flying there's many companies like -- we're not chasing that. We're simply sizing in the airlines in the products we have. And so our confidence in this summer is rooted in. We've already taken a look. We've already made sure that we have appropriate confidence levels in what we can do. So no need for any type of concern over the summer.\nMary Schlangenstein : Okay. And then the second question I had, if we could go back to the NEA for a minute. If the government tells JetBlue, it can acquire Spirit, but it wants big changes in the NEA, what's the prospect for American at that time? Is that something that you could have to walk away from with JetBlue?\nSteve Johnson: Mary, thanks, that's a speculation on speculation on speculation on speculation. Vasu I think really articulated in his comments about how pro-consumer and pro-competitive the NEA is I mean, we could go on and on about that. And if you assume that that JetBlue actually figures out a way to acquire Spirit, and we get to that point, JetBlue-Spirit combination doesn't change impact to consumers of the NEA. It's not going to change one bit the value that we create for consumers in New York and Boston. So I think it's -- there's a lot of water to go into the bridge, obviously, with respect to Frontier and Spirit and JetBlue. But I think there's -- that kind of speculation is probably premature. And we feel really, I think, excited about the prospects of winning our lawsuit with the DOJ. And we're looking forward to continue with the NEA, just in perpetuity.\nMary Schlangenstein : Steve, are there any discussions underway on settling with the DOJ over the NEA? Or do you expect that that's going to go to trial in September?\nSteve Johnson: I expect it'll go to trial in September.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA TODAY.\nDawn Gilbertson : Two questions on masks. Do you foresee -- given the DOJ appeal, do you foresee any scenario in which the mask mandate on plan is reinstated as swiftly as it was removed? And the second thing is how is American handling traveler request for refund, given the -- how quickly the mask mandate was lifted? Are you -- if someone doesn't want to fly they're immunocompromised, are you just giving refunds? What's your policy?\nRobert Isom : Nate, go ahead. Take the first.\nNate Gatten : Yes. I can take the first part of that question. This is Nate. Obviously, we're aware that the DOJ is appealing the Florida ruling, although they have not asked for a stay of the district court judge. Beyond that, as I mentioned earlier, we've learned throughout the pandemic not to speculate on what the government may or may not do. I would emphasize though that in keeping with our commitment to create a welcoming environment for everyone who travels with us, customers and team members may, of course, choose to continue to wear masks at their own discretion. And we expect that many will continue to do so. But especially considering the steps that we've taken for the last couple of years regarding cleanliness and airflow, we don't feel that reinstating of the mandate is necessary at this time.\nRobert Isom : Yes. And Dawn, thanks for the question overall. And just right off, we haven't had much interaction with customers that have said they want to do anything different. But like we do in all these events, we're taking a look at our policies. And we are certainly -- with customers open and asking them to get in touch with our reservations office, and we'll make sure that we accommodate them in an appropriate fashion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Leslie Josephs with CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs : I was wondering how you guys are thinking about IROPS during the summer? And if you have enough capacity and clear capacity to handle rebookings? And how you address that? And just kind of how the overall labor landscape looks, not just pilots, but customer service grounds and other employees?\nDavid Seymour: Yes. I appreciate the question. Certainly, one that we spend a lot of time thinking through and working on. What I'd tell you, we've actually implemented a number of tools knowing that loans are going to be high as we go into the summer, and welcome back a lot more customers. And those tools we've actually been utilizing and have shown good promise here in terms of ensuring that we're not canceling and working our airline through a delay as this weather does develop, and we work our way through it. And that's really the key for us is making sure that we're canceling the few flights as possible to allow the traffic to continue to move through. But again, we're very focused on that. We know that the weather is going to be out there. We're certainly not taking anything for granted.\nRobert Isom : David, also I'll just add. Look, we have 12,000 new team members. And so that's a lot more than the 600 pilots that we have and actually, that 12,000 is net new. We hired, I think, almost 20,000 people. But those people -- team members are working in reservations. They're at our airports. They're throughout the system. So we've beefed up our capacity to be able to handle. And then Maya, do you want to say about anything more about other technology that we're using?\nMaya Leibman: Yes. I think David hit on it. The goal is to prevent the cancellations in the first place so that we don't have to reaccommodate people given the high loads that we expect this summer. And we've got some pretty cool new technology that really focuses on how we manage to do that. In addition, really helping with improving our technology around crew recovery and some optimization technology that will really help reduce our taxing times, our turn times at airports and all of those things together are going to be in place for this summer in order to ensure that we have a better approach to irregular operations.\nLeslie Josephs : Okay. And then my second question is really quick. Does it still make sense for American Airlines to have an award chart just given where demand is and kind of how hard it is to find seats with awards these days, with miles these days?\nVasu Raja: Yes, thanks for the question. Actually, what's been really interesting to us, even though we are seeing an improving fare environment is actually our redemptions are up both in March and as we go forward. As far as the award chart goes, that is certainly something which our top-tier loyalty customers very much value and they see a lot of opportunities for it to go and secure traffic, which many of them have been long anticipated through the pandemic. So as it stands, we're still really encouraged by having an award chart. And encouraged that, frankly, even though we are in a rising environment, we're creating the right level of availability for redemption.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Niraj Chokshi with New York Times.\nNiraj Chokshi : So I think most of my questions were answered already. I guess one question I had on masks was do you anticipate it affecting hiring at all, maybe potential people you might hire might be nervous about sort of the shift, the drop of the requirement?\nRobert Isom : Hey, Niraj. The answer is no. And just so everybody is aware, if our customers and team members want to wear masks, we encourage them. We welcome that, and we see that as a practice that's going to go continue forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Krupnik with CBS News.\nKathryn Krupnik : I hope this is the last time that we have to talk about unreally passengers. But do you have a count on how many of that American has banned? And what are you going to do with those who are banned? Are you going to do what your competitors are doing and doing case-by-case basis?\nNate Gatten: Yes. This is Nate. We don't give account for how many passengers we banned specifically for mask noncompliance. In most cases, the passengers who were added to our internal refuse list, as a result of mask noncompliance, will be permitted to resume travel at some point in time. In cases where an incident may have started with face mask noncompliance and escalated into anything involving something more serious or certainly an assault on one of our key members or customers, those passengers are going to remain on our permanent internal refuse list and will never be allowed to travel with us again. I would just add in this vein, we're very grateful to our partners and the Federal government who have prioritized the safety of our crews, both our grand crews and our crews in the air during this period. And we are really appreciative of the announcement yesterday from the acting FAA Administrator, Billy Nolen, who said that the zero-tolerance policy against unrolled passengers is here to stay as we anticipate unfortunately, that these cases will continue. Although as Robert noted earlier today, hopefully, with a fewer incidents.\nOperator: Thank you, and that's all the time we have for Q&A. I'd like to turn the call back to Robert Isom for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Thank you. I'll just close with this. Look, we've worked really hard as a company to get to at this point to be able to take advantage of an environment where demand is improving. The airline is structured in a really great fashion. I want to thank our team members for working so hard to get us through the pandemic and to be in a position to actually realize everything that we want to make about American. And in terms of the transition as well, this is my first earnings call, I want to thank our Board of Directors, especially Doug Parker for making things really work smoothly, putting us in a position to be talking about things that are very, very favorable. And so for our team, you've heard from a lot of players here today. I couldn't be more proud and confident in the team that we have from a senior leadership perspective. You're going to hear more from them as time goes on. And our job right now is to make the second quarter forecast a reality. That is what we're focused on. So we're going to get out there and make it happen. And I want to thank everybody for their time today.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."}, {"symbol": "AAL", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-01-20 15:46:05", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the American Airlines Group Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.\nDan Cravens: Thank you, Liz and good morning everyone and welcome to the American Airlines Group fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On the call this morning, we have Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President and incoming CEO; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call for our Q&A session are some of our senior executives, including Maya Leibman, Steve Johnson, Vasu Raja, David Seymour, Nate Gatten and Devon May. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and will update the actions we have taken during the pandemic. Robert will then follow up with some remarks about our operations and initiatives for 2022. After Robert\u2019s remarks, Derek will follow with the details on the quarter and provide guidance for the year. After Derek\u2019s comments, we\u2019ll open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin today, we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecasts of capacity and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website and the information that we are giving you on the call this morning is as of today\u2019s date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So, thanks again for joining us this morning. And at this point, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for being on the call. We have a lot to cover today, but I am going to start with the big news since last quarter\u2019s call, at least for me, which is that Robert Isom is going to be the next CEO of American Airlines. That change is effective on March 31. I am going to remain Chairman of the American Board, but importantly, I will have no executive duties. Robert will be fully in charge. I will stand as Chairman for as long as Robert and the Board find that a value. This is terrific news for our team. Robert is going to be the ninth CEO in the nearly 100-year history of American Airlines, which we believe is the best job in all of aviation. And we all are excited for Robert and for American. As you all know, Robert is someone I have worked alongside for several decades. He is an extraordinary team builder, who understands the complexities of operating in an airline like American. He loves the people of American and he brings a fresh perspective to the future of American. I know he is going to accomplish great things and I am looking forward to watching that happen along with all of you. Now, what this transition does mean is this is going to be my last earnings call with you all, which is kind of a big deal for me. I have had a speaking role on every quarterly earnings call since I became CFO of America West Airlines in June of 1995. So by my calculations, this makes this my 107th consecutive quarterly call. So, look, I am going to try not to speak as much on this one as I have on the first 106 calls, especially as it relates to the company\u2019s go-forward plans, rather, I am going to let those who are leading American into the future to talk about that future. But before I turn over the stage, I do have a couple of quick thank yous. First is to you all, the sell-side analysts and the reporters, who cover our business. You all have very important jobs covering this crazy industry that we all love and you do it extremely well. I hope you have great respect for what you do and the challenges you face. And I have done my best throughout my career to treat you with the respect you deserve and to give you access in the community you need to do your jobs well. And you have all been extremely fair to me, which I really appreciate. So, thank you very much as a blanket thank you to all of you on the line. It also goes to some of the great people that proceeded you, former analysts like Carl Carros, Candace Browning, Sam Bucket; and former reporters like Terry Max and Susan Carey and Scott McCarthy. Thank you, all. The second thank you is to the American Airlines team, which I can\u2019t begin to do adequately on this call. But what I can do to somewhat thank them is to tell you all about the phenomenal job they did in 2021. For the year when growing back to meet a huge increase in demand was the most important and challenging objective for all airlines. The American team grew back faster and further than anyone else. We served about 25% more customers than any other airline in 2020, which is phenomenal in our industry. The last time in the U.S. airline was that much larger than the next best next highest competitor was more than 10 years ago and that was done by merging two existing airlines, not through organic growth. This growth in 2021 led us to hire 16,000 new team members last year. We expect to hire another 18,000 in 2022. And our team managed that growth while taking great care of our customers. We posted the best operating performance in our company\u2019s history in 2021 with the highest on-time performance and completion factor we have ever had. And we were the second highest to the four largest airlines in all of those metrics despite the fact we grew back so much further and faster than they did. We are particularly proud of how we ended the year certainly relative to our competitors. Our team had a far more customers than any other airline over holidays, and we did so with much less disruption than our primary competitors. American was the top-performing airline among all airlines in December in each of the key operating metrics. And as our teams performed as well, our customers have taken note. Our full year 2021 likelihood to recommend scores, were the highest in American\u2019s history. That\u2019s an incredible testament to our people, who not only show up everyday to operate the world\u2019s largest airline, but they do so in a way that welcomes back our customers with open arms. And all this translated to our shareholders as well in a year of very difficult stock performance for the industry. American stock increased 19%, far more than any other U.S. airline. So, I want to summarize all this to convey my gratitude to the incredible American Airlines team. And I want to thank each of them on behalf of our customers, our shareholders and everyone who counts on them everyday. It\u2019s this performance that gives us great confidence and momentum as we head into 2022 and beyond. So with that, thank you all again. I am going to now turn it over to our soon-to-be CEO, Robert Isom, to talk about what lies ahead. Robert?\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the entire American Airlines team for their efforts in the fourth quarter and throughout this entire pandemic. And I\u2019d like to reiterate how honored I am to be taking on the role as CEO. I want to express my appreciation for Doug\u2019s partnership and friendship over the years. As you all know, that leaves behind an incredible legacy, having opened many doors for our airlines and our industry. I look forward to continuing to work closely with him over the coming months to ensure a seamless transition. I am taking on this role at a very important time for American. Over the past few years, our airline and our industry have gone through a period of transformative change that American has made good use of that time, especially in regard to renewing our fleet, facilities and network and making the company as efficient as possible. For fleet, we have dramatically simplified. We now operate just four fleet types. That gives us operating flexibility, reliability and efficiency. American\u2019s fleet remains the youngest to the U.S. network carriers. Our aircraft are equipped with industry-leading WiFi, new interiors and we have added seats to our 737 and A321 fleets, bringing us more in line with the rest of the industry. For facilities, we have expanded the number of gates we operate at our largest hubs in Dallas/Fort Worth and Charlotte. And we have inaugurated a wonderful new regional concourse at Reagan National, which is historically our most profitable hub. We have also invested more than $200 million in lounges over the past five years with new Admirals Club lounges opening at Reagan National and LaGuardia. New and upgraded airport spaces are underway in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles as well. And we have also updated maintenance training and corporate spaces throughout the system to ensure our team can perform at an even higher level. For network, we are finding more to where our customers want to go. Our DFW and Charlotte hubs are prime to operate more than 900 and 700 flights per day, respectively. Our partnerships with JetBlue in the Northeast and Alaska in the West Coast allow us to create an industry-leading presence in markets that have historically been difficult for American. And our proposed investments in South American carriers strengthened our already industry-leading position in that region. As demand continues to recover and we return to full utilization of our assets, American is poised to outperform. We have extracted $1.3 billion of efficiencies and we are operating an economic fleet that will provide CASM-X tailwinds as capacity is restored. Based on our current assumptions, we expect all of this to result in a return to profitability later this year and continued deleveraging as we paid down $15 billion of debt by the end of 2025. And I am excited to hit the ground running in April and build on our momentum to deliver results in 2022. So, let\u2019s get to the business in the quarter. This morning, American reported a fourth quarter GAAP net loss of $931 million and a full year GAAP net loss of $2 billion. Excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $921 million for the quarter and a net loss of $5.4 billion for the full year. Our results for 2021 were significantly improved over 2020, but the impact of the Omicron variant has affected the timing of a full revenue recovery. We delivered a strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter, despite the rise in infections. We reported fourth quarter revenues of $9.4 billion, our highest for any quarter since the start of the pandemic and a sequential increase of $458 million from the third quarter. Our cargo team continues to do a fantastic work and delivered record cargo revenues of $1.3 billion in 2021, 30% higher than our previous record. As we have seen throughout the pandemic, each new variant and corresponding increasing cases is followed by a faster recovery of demand with fewer regulatory restrictions and changes in travel policies. Based on what we are seeing, we expect Omicron to follow the same pattern. Bookings are recovering quickly after dropping off considerably in early December, though they are still not back to pre-Omicron levels. Leisure travel, particularly in the U.S. and short-haul international market remains very strong and is approaching a 100% recovery. We expect this trend to continue. And interestingly, we have seen many of our customers that have historically \u2013 we have historically called leisure travelers are actually flying for reasons beyond just vacations. They may fly to a feature or a mountain destination, but they are actually going to work remotely for the week. The lines between leisure and business travel are definitely blurred. The recovery of international and business travel slowed late in the fourth quarter, given the Omicron variant, but we remained very bullish on both. The return of international travel is directly linked to travel restrictions around the globe. As the restrictions falloff, we expect international travel to pickup considerably. We still expect business travel to come back in full, but it will come back in a different way. And by that, I mean the overall mix of business customers, how they travel and how we serve them. As we have shared previously, small and medium sized business travel remains the strongest segment. In the fourth quarter, small and medium business travel was roughly 80% recovered, while large corporate travel was only 40% recovered. In addition, small and medium business revenue had sequential month-over-month improvement in December in spite of the impact of Omicron. We are optimistic that as corporate travel returns in a significant way this year and as companies come back more fully into the office and get back on the road, we are going to be back on track. But as we are developing our plans and forecast for this year, we are working to build an airline that can be profitable even without the full return of managed corporate travel. The demand environment has changed a lot through the pandemic. Because of this, we have to be nimble and responsive. We have built agile processes that allow us to deliver the network our customers need and want, no matter the environment. The game has changed and our team is ready. Growing back our network the way we did in 2020 is a feat in and of itself, but to do so while running a reliable operation and achieving strong revenue results along the way make it even more impressive. We entered 2022 with tremendous confidence as a result of the way we finished last year and started the new year. As Doug noted, American had the best reliability of all U.S. carriers in December and the highest annual likelihood to recommend scores in our history. We are very pleased that 97% of our team has been vaccinated or submitted a request for an accommodation, with no one losing their job. We put creative agreements in place with our union partners to support the operation throughout the pandemic and just recently reached new contract extensions for some of our team members to start the year, all of this while flying more flights and more passengers than any other U.S. carrier by a wide margin. To ensure this momentum continues, we have two sharply focused priorities for this year: running a reliable airline for our customers and returning to profitability. Returning to profitability is very much tied to the demand and revenue environment. But as I mentioned, the work we have done during the pandemic has positioned us very well. This includes our cost and efficiency actions, which Derek will touch on momentarily, as well as the work that we have done to refocus our network around our most profitable clients. Enhancing our partnerships around the U.S. and around the world and driving value through the AAdvantage program and co-brand cards has found something that we have done well. And on an absolute basis, new AAdvantage member acquisitions in 2021 outpaced 2019, despite lower level of capacity and our AAdvantage revenues in 2021 closed in on 2019 revenues. So in summary, we are grateful for the incredible work of the American Airlines team over the past year. We remain optimistic about the return of demand and we are very pleased with how American is positioned, thanks to the tremendous efforts of our team. And now with that, I will turn it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Robert and good morning everyone. Before I review the results, I would also like to thank the American Airlines team for their outstanding work during the quarter. This pandemic has been relentless. And despite the uncertainty, our team continued to show it\u2019s the best in the business. This morning, we reported a fourth quarter GAAP net loss of $931 million or a loss of $1.44 per share. Excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $921 million or a loss of $1.42 per share. For the full year 2021, we reported a GAAP net loss of $2 billion. And excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $5.4 billion. Despite the impact of Omicron that we saw in this quarter, the trajectory of our revenue recovery continues to be positive and it even exceeded our initial expectations as we outlined on our last call. Our fourth quarter revenue was down 17% compared with the same period of 2019 versus our original guidance of down 20%. This gradual improvement makes it even clearer to us that despite the uncertain demand environment, the steps we have taken over the past 24 months to bolster our network and improve our revenue generating capabilities are working. On the cost side, we remain focused on keeping our controllable cost down and we actioned $1.3 billion in permanent annual cost initiatives in 2021, providing a new and more efficient baseline for our 2022 budget. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to invest in the operation with a holiday pay program for our employees as well as reducing our peak holiday capacity. These actions did put pressure on our unit cost performance in the fourth quarter, but they led to a strong operational performance over that period. This included an industry leading month of operating performance in December, when it mattered the most to our customers. On the fleet side, I am pleased to report that our fleet harmonization project is now nearly complete, with our last A321 going into the shop this quarter. This is a full year ahead of our original schedule. We are excited to have this project behind us. In addition to a consistent product and better experience for our customers, the operational benefits of having a simplified and streamlined fleet are already being realized. The changes we have made to our A321s and 737s enable us to fly 2% more total capacity than we could have with the old configuration, thus providing a unit cost tailwind as we continue to build back our network. In addition to better unit cost, these reconfigured aircraft will also generate more revenue, allowing us to recover from the pandemic even faster. With respect to our wide-body aircraft, we continue to have productive conversations with Boeing to determine the timing of our delayed 788 deliveries that were expected to arrive last year. Due to the continued uncertainty of delivery schedule, these aircraft remain out of our near-term schedule to minimize customer disruption. We expect to fly 4 aircraft during our peak summer schedule. We ended the fourth quarter with $15.8 billion of total available liquidity, which is the highest year end liquidity balance in the company\u2019s history. As we have said in the past, the deleveraging of American\u2019s balance sheet remains a top priority and we are committed to significant debt reduction in the years ahead. Even with this volatile demand environment, we remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025. In fact, as of the end of 2021, we have already reduced our overall debt levels by $3.7 billion from our peak levels in the second quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we made $706 million in scheduled debt payments, which resulted in paying off the 2013-1 WTC B tranche. In the first quarter, we expect to make $337 million of scheduled debt payments, which will include unencumbering 12 aircraft. For our pension, our funded status improved by 9.2 points to 77.9%, resulting in a $2 billion reduction in the underfunded liability on a year-over-year basis. Lastly, during the fourth quarter, we completed approximately $960 million of WTC financing, and we now have financing secured for all our 2022 deliveries through the third quarter. Our 2022 budget reflects our priorities to run a reliable airline for our customers and return to profitability. Our plan includes ongoing investments that will help build upon the positive momentum we have seen in our operations while leveraging the cost efficiencies and network enhancements we have talked so much about. We believe these actions will provide a solid baseline for both profitability and free cash flow production when demand has fully recovered. Looking to the first quarter, COVID impacted demand and elevated fuel prices will continue to put pressure on our near-term margins. In this environment, we expect our capacity to be down approximately 8% to 10% versus the first quarter of 2019. Based on current demand assumptions and capacity plans, we expect total revenue to be down approximately 20% to 22% versus the first quarter of 2019. We expect our first quarter CASM, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 8% and 10%. While we expect to be unprofitable on a pre-tax basis in January and February, we anticipate a material improvement and a return to profitability in March as demand returns. As for 2022 capacity, much of our plans are subject to the uncertain timing of deliveries of our 788 aircraft. As I mentioned previously, we removed these aircraft from our near-term schedule to protect our customers. This reduction is worth approximately 1 to 2 points of scheduled capacity for 2022. With this adjustment, we expect to add back our capacity throughout the year and to have full year capacity recovered to approximately 95% of 2019 levels. This of course is subject to the future demand environment and we always have the ability to adapt if demand conditions warrant. As we look at our costs, like other airlines, we are seeing inflationary pressures in fuel prices, hiring and training for both new hires and existing crews as we build back our operation, including on the regional side. We are also seeing increased starting wages for certain work groups, including vendors. In addition, we are seeing unit cost pressures from the rolling 788 delays as well as the impact from our ramp and mechanic contract that was ratified in early 2020. Even with these unit cost pressures, our fleet simplification strategy enables higher aircraft utilization and higher average gauge, both of which will help alleviate some of these pressures. As such, we expect our full year CASM, excluding fuel and special items, to be up approximately 5% versus 2019, with the second half of the year much lower than the first half as we fly in more efficient schedule. For the full year, our projected debt maturities are expected to be $2.6 billion. This includes the cash settlement of our $750 million unsecured notes that mature in June. Without any additional prepayment of debt, we project our total debt will be down $5.4 billion at the end of 2022 versus our peak levels in 2021. With respect to capital expenditures, we expect full year 2022 CapEx to be approximately $2.6 billion, which is significantly lower than in previous years and versus others as our fleet replacement needs are complete. Net aircraft CapEx, including pre-delivery deposits, is expected to be $1.8 billion and non-aircraft CapEx is expected to be $800 million. So in conclusion, we are incredibly proud of our team for their continued resilience in a very challenging environment. With the bold actions we have taken and steadfast commitment of our team, we are well-positioned for the future. Now before we open up the line to questions, I would like to acknowledge Dan Cravens for a minute. Today is Dan Cravens\u2019 62nd call, not quite as many as 107, but 67 is pretty amazing and final earnings call as part of our American Airlines, U.S. Airways and America West team. I\u2019d like to personally thank Dan for his two decades of service, his advocacy for both the airline and our investors and for his friendship. The continuing Dan provided \u2013 or the continuity, excuse me, Dan provided over 20 years in his role across multiple airlines, multiple crisis and a global academic is unmatched. We wish him the best of luck in his next adventure. We will be introducing Scott Long, who will be stepping into Dan\u2019s role from our financial planning organization later this month. So with that, I\u2019d like to open up the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning. Just quickly, Doug, I love your prepared remarks. I know the point wasn\u2019t to make me feel old, but Paul, Candace, Sam, I mean, what a throwback. But it really has been a privilege to speak to you on these calls, all these conferences, all these years. I did want to just add my own thanks and congratulations. And obviously, same goes to my friend, Dan Cravens. First question, on the traffic liability, Derek. So sequentially, from the third quarter to the fourth, it declined by about $360 million, granted this is less than the customary seasonal decline, but Delta and United both experienced flat sequential trends. And I\u2019m just trying to understand what the nuances the puts and takes are, whether it\u2019s a network issue, differences in forward bookings, any additional color on the ATL sequential change?\nDerek Kerr: No, there is not really any difference, any color, I think, from a stored value basis, though that stayed pretty much the same. Future travel dropped from \u2013 I think we were at 6.4 in total ATL balance, future travel was 3.6, went down to 3.2, which is a normal seasonality for us. We did see a pickup at the end of the month or at the end of the month from normal buying. So I think it\u2019s just normal seasonality for us. And what we didn\u2019t see as much as the stored value being used and some additions because, as you know, some of the issues with the cancellations and things that were out there, we added a little bit to that. But I would have expected it to drop even more, but it held up just because of the fact that from an operations standpoint, there were \u2013 we added a little bit in the fourth quarter from issues with the operation. But other than that, I think it\u2019s just seasonality or what we normally see. I\u2019m not sure why others were flat or up other than what they did.\nJamie Baker: All right. That\u2019s perfect. And just a quick follow-up, and I don\u2019t want to get bogged down in comparing your guides to that of United and Delta, but you all expect to arrive at a pretty similar first quarter revenue outcome, down 20-plus points from \u201819. But you have to fly considerably more capacity to arrive at that output. Can you just remind us what some of the seasonal and network factors that drive this? I understand there is more seasonality for you in the first quarter, but I\u2019m just trying to figure out what causes that drag.\nVasu Raja: Hey, Jamie, this is Vasu. The reality of where we still are in the first quarter is that there is still probably a pretty large variability in first quarter forecast. And so much like Derek, I won\u2019t comment on what our competitors are looking at. But we have taken a pretty conservative view of what revenue production will be in Q1. We\u2019ve been encouraged by recent trends as case growth spikes. We\u2019re already seeing bookings come in stronger. So we will see. But what we see to realize through the pandemic is that we have a lot of levers to go play in the airline really flexibly, and we can shift things up and down and indeed move capacity from one market to another far more nimbly than we had in times past. And after so many crises, we thought we were nimble before and we got even faster. So there is still a lot yet to do in the first quarter, and we will see how things come together as demand start hitting back up.\nJamie Baker: Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you, gentlemen. Take care.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Jamie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. And yes, really to echo a lot of what Jamie said. Doug, it\u2019s been a privilege really. And I\u2019ve learned a lot going all the way back to the early 2000s and Dan as well. Dan, you\u2019ve been a great friend and you\u2019ve been a great supporter. And so Scott, you\u2019ve got some pretty big shoes to fill there.\nDan Cravens: Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Thanks Mike.\nMike Linenberg: Just quickly on to questions. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to get some along these lines. I just want to hit on sort of this G5-ish \u2013 or excuse me, G5, 5G issue. The FA was out, I think, yesterday or two days ago saying something like 62% of the U.S. fleet is \u2013 should be fine. Where do you guys stack up? And the way we should think about this, is this going to be \u2013 is this going to blow over over the next few weeks or is this going to sort of reappear five, six months down the road, when maybe some of these exemption zones or buffer zones around airports, maybe there is changes there. Like what should we be concerned about? What should we anticipate as this 5G rolls out over time? Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Okay. They are asking me to take this one even though I was wondering to talk very much, Mike. This has been like my last assignment. Anyway \u2013 This is look \u2013 and we\u2019ve all been \u2013 every airline, all CEOs that involve this over the holidays, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s -anyway, it wasn\u2019t our finest hour, I think, as a country to get us to that point. But the good news is we now have what should have been going on for quite some time, which is the manufacturers, the telecoms, the government agencies all sharing information that they need to make sure that this can be rolled out in a way that all Americans get 5G and all Americans know that their flights aren\u2019t going to be impacted by that 5G. So where we sit right now is the way that we\u2019re all able to upgrade our fleet is because the telecoms have agreed not to fully deploy some of their towers near airports. So with that agreement, everything is fine. Again, I will turn to David. As far as you\u2019ll ever see, everything is totally fine. You see, we don\u2019t expect really any material disruption whatsoever as long as that\u2019s in place. I think that\u2019s not gong to stay in place. We need to get to where they can actually \u2013 and we want to get to where they actually can deploy all the towers they have in place and that we can still do that. But no one\u2019s going to make \u2013 no one\u2019s going to go do that until we all agree that it can be done without disruption. So, a long way of me saying, it\u2019s taken a while to get to the right spot, but I feel like we\u2019re in the right spot and the right people to derive information. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see any material disruption going forward because of this.\nMike Linenberg: Great. That\u2019s what I wanted to hear. And just, Derek, a quick one on the non-op expense, $360 million for the quarter. Because of where your pension is and maybe the potential gains that you\u2019re anticipating and how you book it into 2022, is there going to be a pension tailwind not only in the March quarter, but for the year and any sort of rough estimate on what we should use from a modeling perspective? Thank you.\nDerek Kerr: Yes. I think there is a pension tailwind into the year. So if we ended up the quarter 380 for this quarter. We\u2019re projecting it to be in the 350 range from now and slowly declining as we pay off some debt throughout the quarter. So, I would \u2013 first quarter should be more in the 350, 360 range and declining to about the 340 range in the fourth quarter.\nMike Linenberg: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thank you very much operator. And yes, Doug, it\u2019s been really nice knowing you, but hopefully, we will continue to stay in touch. And Dan, I mean you\u2019ve been a really good supporter. Actually, your whole team has been a really good support of our conferences over the years. So thank you very much and best wishes to both of you. And I refused to tell you how many of those conference calls.\nDoug Parker: I think I know, but thanks so much.\nHelane Becker: No worries. So actually, I guess, I don\u2019t know, maybe Vasu or Robert. Can you just address two things? There \u2013 you guys have said you\u2019re going to hire, I guess, a gross number of 18,000 people this year. And some of those are going to be pilots. We\u2019re seeing United and American \u2013 or Delta, rather, cut regional jet capacity because they don\u2019t have enough pilots. Are you going down that similar path? Or are you in a better position from a training perspective?\nRobert Isom: So Helane, thanks. It\u2019s Robert. Thanks for that question. So we are going to be doing a lot of hiring this year. We did a lot of hiring as well last year. So from a tone perspective, we had a couple of years of the pandemic in which, quite frankly, there weren\u2019t a lot of people being trained. And given the demand, we \u2013 the capacity in the industry fell by quite a bit. So as we all rebound, of course, there is a constraint that we are all dealing with. There is not enough production. I do \u2013 a pilot. I do believe that over time that, that supply and demand imbalance will be remedied. It\u2019s an incredibly attractive profession when you think about the starting wages and the ultimate compensation for the industry. So we\u2019re doing everything that we can, and I know other companies are as well, to encourage those that are looking for a great profession to come into the business. But in the short run, from a mainline perspective, look, we have \u2013 American is a very, very attractive brand. We\u2019re going to have plenty of pilots. The biggest issue that we\u2019re dealing with is the throughput of pilots and getting them through training. We\u2019ve invested an incredible amount of resources and having training assets ready to go. Those are all coming online. And again, from a mainline perspective, we will be able to supply all that we need. The imbalance is really going to be played out in the regional carriers. And on that front, like other carriers, we\u2019re going to have issues as well. We have them right now. We\u2019re working very hard on that. It\u2019s impacting us to a certain degree, but we\u2019re going to do everything that we can to make sure that it\u2019s not a material impact over time.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And then just my follow-up question, I don\u2019t know who wants to answer this one. But when you talk about small- and medium-sized businesses and those folks who are traveling, because they really have to for their livelihood, can you talk about also whether they have got the credit card and if you\u2019re seeing increased credit card acquisition in that category?\nVasu Raja: Hey, Helane, this is Vasu, and I\u2019m happy to answer your question. Indeed, this is one of our increasingly fair topics to talk about. You are correct. We see small and mid-market business growth. But look, the diversity of who that customer is really can\u2019t be overstated, everybody from somebody starting a business to sometimes relatively large companies who are seeing growth through the pandemic and get on the road to drive sales or visit factories or whatever the case might be. And for us, we do very \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen growing acquisitions on our co-branded credit cards. Indeed, in Q4, it\u2019s not just that our spend level were eclipsed in 2019. But our acquisitions, even net of attrition, was equal to and very often, for some months and some weeks, greater than what it was in 2019, which means that where people are coming to the card. That said, we see a real opportunity within the space of small business, mid-market business because the reality is we don\u2019t actually have a true card product or an entire consumer offering for that segment. A lot of things that we have are either tailored for really large corporate accounts or individual travellers. So we see a lot of opportunity as we come out of this and a lot of ways to go and drive a lot more value to that customer and captured in our P&L.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much Vasu. Thanks everybody.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you both the same question I asked Gary and Bob at their Investor Day. You have worked together for a long time as a team. But from a change perspective, is there any daylight between the two of you strategically? And do you have any examples of issues where you really constructively disagreed over the last decade?\nRobert Isom: Hey, Duane. Thanks. I\u2019ll start. Look, Doug and I are different leaders, and we definitely go about how we lead the company in different ways. But I\u2019ll tell you that in terms of the strategic direction of American, I\u2019ve not only worked with Doug, but I\u2019ve been part of every major decision in this company over the last \u2013 since the merger. And so from that perspective, we\u2019re doing the right thing. I\u2019m excited about the positioning of American. The assets that we\u2019ve put in place, whether it\u2019s fleet airport, alliances, our network, we\u2019re ready to go. As demand recovers and we can put our assets to full utilization, we\u2019re poised to outperform. So from that perspective, I don\u2019t expect to hear a lot of difference in terms of the way that Doug does things. But right now, I am solely focused on making sure that we deliver a great product for our customers, and that\u2019s running a reliable airline, and getting back to profitability.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks for the thoughts and appreciated. It\u2019s a tricky question. Maybe one for Vasu, how different would March quarter capacity have been if we never had Omicron? Maybe this is an unfair observation, but it feels like Americans\u2019 plans relative to the industry are very static in what is obviously a very dynamic world. Appreciate you taking the questions.\nVasu Raja: Yes. Absolutely, and I appreciate the question. Look, it\u2019s sort of hard to do what hypotheticals would be. But what I would say is this. The part of the reason why maybe there is probably less volatility in our schedules is where our airline\u2019s sort of naturally positioned. We \u2013 not only do we operate a lot more of our capacity in domestic, we generate a lot more of value for customers and RASM results from flying in domestic. So for most of the pandemic, certainly the last several months, we\u2019ve oriented about 85ish percent of our ASM capacity in the domestic and short-haul operations. As we go in the first quarter, it will be about 80ish percent in those, with another 5% or so constituting major international markets like one at Heathrow, for example. So for us, so much of our network is there, indeed. So 65% of our network is in our \u2013 what we call Sunbelt hubs, Phoenix, DFW, Charlotte, D.C., Miami, that have been extremely robust through the pandemic, and any one of those hubs produce unit revenues, which are well in excess of what our competitors do. So a little bit of what you see as a network composition difference, quite frankly. As we go out in the first quarter, quite briefly, we are flying the things where we can most directly create value for the customer and outperform. And we\u2019re not doing the things that don\u2019t. So our long-haul schedules are 70% of what they have historically been. Our short-haul schedules are a lot closer to what flat is. So what it would be like when demand is that remains to be seen. But for us, the real opportunity when we said it all through the pandemic is less about driving volume. And the capacity base, the cost base of the airline changes only very marginally, whether we fly at 95% or 92% of the airline. The really big thing for us is domestic yield performance. And as we look out, I mean, if indeed demand comes back where we see it is less about how we go and manipulate capacity around the system and more about how we capture it in yield growth.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughts.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Good morning. Robert, as you think about taking over the CEO role, what are some of the things that you want to accomplish in your first 100 days? Maybe when your ability to put your stamp on things is at its highest.\nRobert Isom: Hunter, I\u2019m going to just be really clear and focused on that. Our goal right now is to get back to profitability as soon as possible to deliver a reliable product, plain and simple. As I take a look forward, we\u2019ve got a great opportunity ahead of us. And everything come together is the right time. I do think that we\u2019re in a position where demand is poised to react. Everything that we see suggests that there is a pent-up desire for people to get out on the road, whether it\u2019s for leisure or business demand. And for that, I think I\u2019ve got a special opportunity, one that brings together everything that we\u2019ve been bringing \u2013 working so hard to do throughout the pandemic and bringing that to fruition. So as I take look out to the middle of the year, I do think that we\u2019re going to get back to profitability. I do think that American is going to continue to a very reliable airline, and I think we\u2019re going to be very, very competitive in all the markets that we serve.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And I always \u2013 we talked about capacity being driven demand and fuel cost occasionally but what if you\u2019re not able to hire people? And what if you\u2019re not able to hire the right people that fit the culture that you want to build at American? Is there a decision where you would decide to be smaller as opposed to hiring people that might not be great cultural fits?\nRobert Isom: So, Hunter, thanks for that question, because look, this is something that I\u2019m really proud of. Last year, as we built back, the entire economy, all industries had struggled with finding the right people, getting them in the right positions. But you know what, American, as we grew back, we really quickly remedied any issues that we had. And what we found is American is a very, very attractive place to work. American Airlines sells itself in terms of attracting people to it. So whether it\u2019s the new flight attendant classes that are now graduating, whether it\u2019s the thousands of people that we\u2019re bringing on to work in our reservations and agent ranks and those pilots and mechanics that we\u2019re bringing on to work in our reservations and agent ranks and those pilots and mechanics that we are bringing in, we at American, get a chance to really choose those that get to be part of the team. And that\u2019s a great position to be in. Over time, I think that we are going to have to do a lot of work to make sure that the supply of pilots, into our regional carriers is as strong as we needed to be. But you will see us on the forefront of that as well.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Hunter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning everybody and congratulations to everybody on their next chapters here. Derek, first question for you on cash flow, if we are looking out at a full year guidance, you have laid out CapEx at 2.6? Should we be expecting cash from operations to cover that? I am just going to get a sense for how secure we should be looking at the balance sheet and the liquidity that you have on there, we are going to be definitive to that from an operating standpoint, are we going to be able to cover that, based on what you see today?\nDerek Kerr: We will definitely be able to cover that.\nDavid Vernon: Excellent. Short and sweet, I like it. Second question maybe for Robert or Derek, as you look at the capacity and the CASM-X guidance you have given for 2022, down 5, up 5, how do we think about in broad brushes \u201822 to \u201823? If we are up a little, relative to \u201819 and is that just going to be kind of a one for one thing or is there more beta to that, like, how should we be thinking about the operating leverage coming back into the business as demand gets restored?\nDerek Kerr: Yes, I think exactly what you are saying I think we are under utilizing our fleet without a doubt at this point in time. I think as we add back our assets, Robert, Robert talks about pilot\u2019s affordability and making sure the throughput happens and get the throughput through. So, if we \u2013 and the 78, so you have two opportunities to grow this airline at a very cheap cost, I think the cost headwind, there is probably 3 or 4 points of cost headwind we have in place right now with underutilizing our assets and making sure that when those aircraft get back and we can use them as much as we can, we do not need to add cost, we do not need to add aircraft. So, we could in today\u2019s world, we could fly the airline probably 5% more with the cost structure we have today. So it\u2019s pretty close to one for one. It might be a little bit sticky in there a little bit, but it\u2019s pretty darn close to one for one on the first 5% that we could add back.\nDavid Vernon: Alright. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, good morning. Congrats to both Doug and Dan on what an amazing run it\u2019s been. It\u2019s really been a pleasure. A couple of questions here. One housecleaning question, just one follow-up on small and medium-sized businesses. Vasu, what\u2019s factored into the first quarter revenue outlook with respect to the timing of international returning, are you just sort of straight lining current trends or did you factor in some kind of escalation in March potentially?\nVasu Raja: Hey, great question. And you are absolutely correct. We are \u2013 our straight lining current trends with a load exception of our short-haul business.\nDan McKenzie: Okay.\nVasu Raja: It tends to peak in the March, April time period as North America goes on spring breaks and Easter vacations.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. Very good. Secondly, just following up on Helane\u2019s question on small and medium-sized businesses, I am wondering if you can elaborate on kind of their purchase behavior versus a typical leisure travel or delay book further out closer in, it\u2019s presumably higher margin business. I am just trying to get a sense of what that means. And I guess I didn\u2019t in the PowerPoint, I guess or I didn\u2019t catch what that revenue from small and medium sized business was as a percent of 2019 revenue and how you are thinking about that turning potentially here in 2022?\nVasu Raja: Sure. Maybe let me answer those in a slightly different order. First, small business \u2013 as we ended December, what we call small and mid-market business was 80% recovered. Large corporate business people who bought on big managed programs was 40% recovered ballpark. Interestingly, what that means for us, historically, as 40% of our revenues came from business, about 15 points of that were from large corporates and the balance were from small and mid-market companies. Due to the pandemic that shifted a lot, where less than 10 points comes from manage corporates. As we think about next year, we absolutely anticipate a rebound of business travel. But something where something \u2013 a lot more closer to 30 points of the 40 points or so is coming from small to mid-market and manage corporates come down a little. This is something which is certainly an opportunity that we look upon very favorably and may in many ways be unique to American Airlines, because so much of that small business growth, to your question about the profile does actually book in a very similar booking window as large corporate travel, is that much shorter days to departure than what leisure is. But very critically, it\u2019s originating in markets that are in the center of the country being Oklahoma City or Austin, San Antonio, places like that. It engages in trip behavior, which is very different than manage corporate. People are willing to go stay a Saturday night and fly on a lower load factor flight. But very importantly, it comes in at the same level as yields of large corporate businesses. But at a fraction of the cost of sales, the cost of sales looks a lot more like what leisure is. So, we see this as a sign of real opportunity. And indeed, as we look out there, and if you think about things, we see that \u2013 to Robert\u2019s comments earlier, the nature of this travel is starting to change that, as we see small businesses traveling. There are more people traveling for a blend of business leisure purposes, more people willing to go buy themselves a premium bear product when a cheaper one is available. So, we have seen a lot of opportunity as the world changes. And we are going to position ourselves to execute on that.\nDan McKenzie: That\u2019s terrific. Thanks Vasu.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. And just want to echo my congratulations to Doug and Dan. It\u2019s really been a pleasure working with you the last, I guess, almost 12 years now. So, thanks for the good time. Question, maybe just on your 2022 growth outlook for that 5%, I understand that the uncertainty around the 787 this makes it more difficult. But can you share high level what you are thinking the breakout between domestic and international growth is based on your current 78 assumption? And what\u2019s driving the decision on where to allocate that capacity? Thanks.\nVasu Raja: Yes. Hey, this is Vasu, I can help with that. We are \u2013 as we see at \u2013 this is maybe your first question. We anticipate that with the 787, we will be a materially smaller international airline what we would otherwise like to be, operating something which is probably, let\u2019s call it 75% to 85% of the scale we had in 2019. But our short-haul network, domestic and the narrowbodies, we fly in Mexico, Caribbean, Latin America, will probably be a lot closer to what 2019 is. But there is a couple of other important things to note there. Of course, first, we have a very conservative view of what happens with the 787s. And indeed, a pretty conservative view about how international demand even recovers through the course of the year. So, a big mix of our international flying. And you can already see it in published schedules, is oriented around markets where we can go a drive a lot of the connectivity through whether it\u2019s Heathrow or other partner hubs, Doha things like that, that we might not have in times. The other thing that\u2019s out there too, into an earlier comment I made, we have a lot more flexibility with the airline. And indeed, due to the pandemic we have come to realize that much easier. Within a few points, we have a lot of flexibility on how we go and plan the airline. And so we are consciously trying to build the airline so that we can be really efficient and how we utilize our assets and make moves around the system so that we can go fly the markets that customers demand most, even if it\u2019s relatively late in the booking curve. So, while those broad strokes of where capacity is still fit, things may change and realistically they will change as demand comes back.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Got it. And then maybe one more for you again Vasu, just to dig into your short-term revenue outlook a bit more, understand there is a lot of moving pieces. But your RASM performance versus \u201819 improved each quarter to 2021. It looks like it\u2019s going to get worse in the first quarter period guidance, of course you call out impact of Omicron. But can you help us think of the drivers a bit more and anything we should know about cargo or other revenue trends, or is that really just your conservative view, as you noted on loads and pricing on the passenger side? Thanks for the time.\nVasu Raja: Look, it\u2019s very much the conservative view and that\u2019s been gone through multiple waves of the pandemic, one of the things that we have come to more reliably build forecasts on is the amount of time it takes from cases peaking to demand recovering. And that\u2019s shortened through every wave. In the Delta wave, it was about a seven-week spread between case peaking to demand bottoming out and growing again. So, a lot of our outlook is based on a slightly shortened version of that occurring. But indeed, what we have been seeing as cases have peaked, wherever they have peaked in the world, Israel, UK, more recently in domestic, it\u2019s not a seven-week span, it\u2019s not a four-week span, it\u2019s something a lot more like a seven- day span. So, it\u2019s still early to tell, as I mentioned earlier, 85% of our capacity is in domestic and if you presume last week was the peak of cases across the country. We have been encouraged by the last few days of bookings. But a lot of our first quarter forecast is based on the conservatism that we have had. We are having seen prior waves before. And indeed, we anticipate that January and February, will remain challenged, because historically, they are seasonally some of the weakest months in our business. So, we will see, but we remain encouraged for how strong demand comes back and we are certainly reserving every seat, because there is a customer that wants to travel and wants to tune.\nDoug Parker: Let\u2019s go and move on to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. Doug, just want to extend my congratulations as well. And the same goes to Dan Cravens. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with both of you over the years. Just first question, around costs, I guess Derek, does the 5% CASM guide include anything from current labor negotiations? And then just secondly, on costs, when we factor in kind of new labor deals, all the kind of the inflation in the economy that you were discussing earlier, even as capacity comes back, do you think that getting back to pre-pandemic CASM-X is a realistic expectation over the next few years?\nDerek Kerr: Yes. It does not include \u2013 I mean, it includes year-over-year deals that were already done. So, any deal that is already done is built in. As Robert talked about, we got some real \u2013 we got some deals done in the past few weeks that weren\u2019t huge impact on the costs, but really good opportunity to get those deals done and get them done quick with some our groups. But it does not include any new contract negotiations that are complete today. So, that\u2019s number one. Number two, I do think we had expected 2022 to get back to 2019 levels. But with the variant and pulling down the flying from 78 is not being there and also demand not quite being there, we will not get to the 2019 levels. As we get into 2023, it\u2019s definitely possible. It depends on the growth of the airline and other things that we do. If we don\u2019t get there, we will get very close, put it that way. So, I think in 2023, we have kind of \u2013 I have always talked about being pretty flat in 2022. That\u2019s not happening really driven by that fully utilizing our assets. As we fully utilize those assets and we plan in 2023, I think we can get to that level or pretty close. We might not get all the way down to 2019. But we will get pretty close.\nAndrew Didora: That\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly for me, for Robert, I guess as you assume the CEO role here, what do you think American needs to do better and I will call it this new role post-pandemic to help drive Americans\u2019 margins back towards pre-pandemic levels? Thanks.\nRobert Isom: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Hey, look, we need to put all the pieces together, all the things that we have been working on over the last 3 years, and then bring them the baton and execute next year well, running reliably British Airline. I know pays off in terms of unit revenues or pays off in terms of unit costs. And it definitely pays off in terms of customer satisfaction. Again, American has invested in all the right places. When we talk about the aircraft and airports and lounges and what that, and that\u2019s money that has been spent. It\u2019s in place. And now it\u2019s time to bring it back and put it into action. And so we do that. I am quite confident. As Derek has said, I am quite confident in all aspects American is poised to outperform.\nDoug Parker: Thanks Andrew.\nOperator: That concludes the analysts\u2019 Q&A. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Hi. I just was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your expectations for 787 deliveries? And kind of how confident you are, anything that you are hearing from Boeing about what they might expect in terms of the schedule on that?\nDerek Kerr: Yes, Ali, this is Derek. We are still on the same schedule. Mid-April is what we are talking about for our first delivery. That has been locked in on those dates for probably the last couple of months, and we are still planning on that happening. So, we haven\u2019t got any different information in the past couple of months, where I think we are still on target for those and that we would take all 13 throughout the year. But we have been conservatively put four in the schedule for the summer. We had originally thought we could get all 13 in the summer, but pulled that down to four. And we have had really good discussions with Boeing. And I think they are on track as of today to hit that mid-April timeframe. And we are hopeful that that\u2019s still the case and nothing else comes up.\nAlison Sider: Got it. And is this something \u2013 is this a situation where you would seek any kind of compensation from Boeing for the delays, or if there was a further delay, is that something you would discuss?\nDerek Kerr: Yes. We are in discussions with Boeing where we are at. There are delayed penalties that are paid and Boeing is paying the delayed penalties. And everything is happening as we speak today. If there are further delays, and it really does impact the summer much more than what we think it is, then \u2013 we have had good discussions with Boeing that they will compensate us for the losses that we have had for the delay of those aircraft.\nAlison Sider: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Koenig with the Associated Press.\nDavid Koenig: Thanks. Hi Doug, well, congratulations as well. I hope you have a great retirement. And you have mentioned 5G in this week\u2019s agreement with Verizon and AT&T. I wondered how long do you get a signal and how long they are willing to delay their full rollout? And why did this have to come down to an 11th hour crisis like this?\nDoug Parker: Yes. Thanks, David. We get the sense that they are \u2013 again, the right people are talking to each other, and everyone agrees that it doesn\u2019t make sense to deploy any more 5G until we are certain that it\u2019s not going to have a disruptive effect on airlines. So again, that\u2019s where we stand at this point. I hope that\u2019s where we will stay. I feel really good about this role David, because again, the right people are talking to each other. Why it took this long to the right people to talk to each other, I don\u2019t know. We can do a post audit later. I am not quite certain. Frankly, we are the end user of this dysfunction. It got \u2013 we are the ones affected. Our customers are the ones affected. And as it was getting ready to be deployed, and we were, therefore, being told what that was going to mean to our operations, we screamed as loud as we could. And fortunately, people listened. So, that\u2019s where we are today, and what should have happened prior to this is happening now. The technical experts that are working on it tell us it\u2019s really not that complicated once they all are able to share information and work on it. So, they seem encouraged that we will be able to address this in a way that allows for full deployment of 5G, including near airports, I mean again, with lower levels or whatever is required and also doesn\u2019t allow for \u2013 it doesn\u2019t require any disruption on air travel. So, that\u2019s where we are. I don\u2019t expect until we get to the point that everyone is really comfortable that, that you will see anything turned on near airports because no one wants to go through this again.\nDavid Koenig: So, are the airlines talking directly to the telecoms, or are you going through the regulators?\nDoug Parker: Look, it\u2019s much more about the manufacturers our OEMs talking directly to the telecoms, which is happening. So, the Boeings, the Airbuses, the Palaces, Honeywell, Collins, etcetera, talking to their counterparts at AT&T and Verizon, obviously, with FAA involvement. But it\u2019s what needed to happen is now happening is you needed those organizations, those companies able to talk to each other and share information. Because when you do that, we can get results because people are willing to work together. We hadn\u2019t have that, instead we had government agencies talking to each other, and that\u2019s \u2013 that can be less productive.\nDavid Koenig: Alright. Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Thanks David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: Good morning. Congratulations, Doug and Robert both. I wanted to ask you if you could talk a little bit about how much of a delay you see the Omicron flare up having on the return to more near normal travel? One of your competitors said it pushes it out 60 days. But I wonder how that ties in with Vasu\u2019s comments about the shortening time between a peak and a bottoming out and then a recovery in demand?\nRobert Isom: Hey Mary, we don\u2019t probably see things a lot different. Look, I think that we were recovering nicely after the Delta variant as we took a look into the Thanksgiving timeframe. But then Omicron hit, demand dropped off fairly rapidly. And yes, demand is recovering faster than it had in previous ways. But I think it \u2013 we don\u2019t view demand as anything more than delayed. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s diminished. And if you are taking a look in kind of the one month or the two months, three months timeframe of how demand \u2013 the rebound is pushed out, I think that, that\u2019s the appropriate timeframe. And for us, as Vasu has mentioned, I know Doug earlier said as well, look, as we take a look out in February, especially as we get to current period, we see a lot of demand and a lot of strength in the bookings that we are seeing already. So, I do think that as Omicron, we are going to come out strong.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. And if I could quickly ask, in discussing increased wage levels going forward and as you try to hire more people, is American contemplating at all potentially other unilateral pay increase for unionized workers, either any particular groups or maybe on a more broader basis?\nRobert Isom: And Mary, as I mentioned earlier in the call, American has a very attractive brand. We have incredibly generous compensation benefits programs. We attract people right now with the positions that \u2013 and the compensation structure that we have. In various pockets throughout the country, various positions like in regional carriers, we take the appropriate action that we have to. But I feel really confident in where we are today and what we are contemplating in being able to track the right people in the right numbers and getting in front of it, too.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Leslie Josephs with CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi. Good morning everyone. I was just wondering what you guys think the impact is going to be of the multiple labor negotiations you have going on now. You have seen complaints about the issues with quality of life, the schedule changes. So, curious if that changes how you think about scheduling the airline going forward? And what sort of \u2013 like what maybe you are saying with pay increases in 2022 and beyond, how do you see that going?\nRobert Isom: Hi, Leslie. Thanks for the question. Here is the one thing I know is that everybody at American is joined in the goal and objective of running a really reliable airline, one that returns to profitability as soon as possible. And so I know that our labor leaders, our team members, they want a profitable and successful American Airlines as we go forward. So, as we take a look into any negotiations, I know that that\u2019s the false and good we are all taking. It\u2019s \u2013 it has to be a mindset of taking care of our team members certainly, but also making sure we take care of the company and our shareholders. And that\u2019s a balance that we have always been able to maintain and will do going forward. So, as I think \u2013 I look going forward, as I said before, I know that we can attract team members to American Airlines. And there are ways we can get better. And by better, it means running an airline that is more reliable too. And I know everybody is joined in that goal.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thanks. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the 787, Derek, did you say that Boeing is definitely paying compensation now, and they could pay even more if the summer schedule is affected?\nDerek Kerr: The first answer is yes. I mean there is delayed penalties that are always in all of these contracts. And Boeing is paying the delayed penalties for each one of these contracts, 320s aircraft. And then the rest of it will be in negotiation as we talk to them. I mean hopefully, we don\u2019t have to do anything. And hopefully, they hit the schedule that they have, and we don\u2019t have any disruption as we go forward. But we have been told from the highest level of the Boeing team that if there is compensation needed to come to the airline that they are fully abreast to help us and to overcome the cost that the 787 has caused us over these last \u2013 the delay in those aircraft has cost us over the last few years. And that\u2019s a negotiation we will have with the Boeing team.\nLeslie Josephs: In addition to what they are already paying for the existing delay?\nDerek Kerr: Correct.\nLeslie Josephs: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Slotnick with TPG.\nDavid Slotnick: Good morning. Thank you for the question and congratulations, Doug. Robert, during your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about a blurring of line between business and leisure travel. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a bit? Does it translate to higher yields, premium cabin sales, etcetera?\nRobert Isom: Vasu is going to take this. Go ahead.\nVasu Raja: Yes. Hey David, great to hear from you. Yes, we plan to be a really encouraging trend. We do see a blurring of lines where the trip patterns are changing Thursday, which is still our biggest business day of the week, is also becoming one of our biggest leisure days of the week. We are having more people who buy business style, fare products, travel as if it\u2019s a business trip, but they are going to places, major destinations, Fort Walton Beach, things like that. So, that behavior is starting to change. And we can trace the things where people work Fridays remotely or can spend a week or two weeks at a time working from some place that is not where they live. So, all that\u2019s creating a lot more variation of how we have historically thought about business and leisure, but in that is a lot of opportunity. But clearly, as we go through the pandemic, customers have a lot more flexibility with their time. There is a lot more savings that are out there, and travel has always been one of the most aspirational things for U.S. consumers. So, we see a lot of that, and we benefited a lot \u2013 from a lot of that in our short-haul network the most. Our premium cabin sales have been the most robust in places like the Caribbean and leisure destinations in the U.S. more so than they have been and more prototypical business destinations like the Transcon markets or London Heathrow. So, we are really encouraged by that trend. We think that it\u2019s going to lead to a lot of things. That\u2019s why we have done a lot of things where we are increasingly rewarding travel, which is not just for how frequently people fly but for simply spending on our credit cards or spending all across the airline. And from my earlier comments, we think there is even more to do, which can be really great for our customers and, of course, really great to the airline, too.\nDavid Slotnick: Thanks Vasu, and just as a follow-up. Do you see the impact of inflation leading to anything involved in higher ticket fares, higher prices for customers?\nVasu Raja: Look, it remains to be seen. I mean this industry has a long history with inflation where it hasn\u2019t always bled so cleanly into fares. So, we will see, and we don\u2019t make any future commentary about pricing. But it\u2019s early to tell and how \u2013 whether this level of inflation stays or not if you had really to go and guess at that, too.\nDavid Slotnick: Great. Thank you very much.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today.\nDoug Parker: Hi Dawn.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi. Good morning. I got to say, Doug, I am really jealous. This is your last call, but I m very happy for you and your family.\nDoug Parker: Thanks.\nDawn Gilbertson: I have a couple of questions, first, for Vasu, following up on Mary\u2019s question about kind of the lag in bookings because of Omicron spring break and summer. I am wondering whether you guys are considering extending your \u2013 the expiration date for tickets and for current travel credits? And my second question is probably for Robert, but maybe not. Your call times, like a lot of airlines still are pretty high, as recently as Friday, it was four hours plus. Can you give any specifics on what you are doing to address this persistent problem and what\u2019s behind it? Thanks very much.\nRobert Isom: Hi. It\u2019s great to hear from you, Dawn. I will start and then others can add in to. So, first of all, we are assessing different options for what we call stored value, what we do with people who have COVID-related credits that are out there. We have been really encouraged by what we have seen. We are the only airline that allows customers to do name changes and reassign them. Because of that, we have seen a lot of consumers go and take advantage of that flexibility. And so that, combined with the fact that we have flown with bigger airlines, has led us to at least believe that we may be seeing is probably a little bit different than others. But we are assessing what our options are, and we will have more in the not distant future.\nVasu Raja: Thanks Dawn, and Maya may want to help me out with this. But hey, with reservations right now with so many changes that are going on in the environment, whether it\u2019s travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, schedule changes, you name it, the level of calls that we are getting right now is really unprecedented, and for good reasons. And what we are trying to do with \u2013 to make sure is that not only do we have all of the resources from a reservations perspective available. But we are also investing in things like chat and then callback functions as well. And one of the things I am really proud of is while we have had some extended callback times as of late, I am really proud of the way we have performed throughout the pandemic. American has consistently performed better than a lot of our competitors. And as we come out of this huge call volume spike and I expect us to get back to really reasonable and satisfactory times. Maya, do you want to add anything else?\nMaya Leibman: Yes. Just following up on some of the technologies that we have implemented in res around a virtual assistant, which is sort of artificial intelligence that can respond to some of the easier questions without the customer having to interact with an agent, and they can \u2013 that\u2019s a win-win because the customer can really do that asynchronously and get their answer in short order, then this is on to that for more difficult questions. Our res agents are now trained. We have hundreds now trained to be able to handle a chat. And again, this allows them to handle more than one interaction at a time, which is better for our customers and more productive for our agents. And then but like Robert said, that really helps defray some of the impact to reservations. But at the end of the day, the nature of the questions that we are getting are so complex, where people are really wanting to fully understand what are the COVID restrictions in traveling here, what kind of vaccination status do I have to have, how do I use store value combined with this form of payment? And in those cases, we still need our fabulous res agents to be able to handle those.\nDawn Gilbertson: Thank you very much.\nDoug Parker: Hey, Dawn, before you sign off, with everyone listening in, as you would have absolutely been in my prepared remarks versus except you are still on the line, but look, of all the \u2013 for those who don\u2019t know, Dawn has covered airlines here is on our public when we started America West. So, when we were at America West really. Of all the articles that I have read, I have to the level that I have chosen to actually hang on to you, Dawn, more than we have Dawn Gilbertson by the line than anybody else. So, thank you very much. Really, really appreciate it.\nDawn Gilbertson: Thank you, Doug. It\u2019s been a pleasure.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Dawn. Yes, thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nDoug Parker: I think we are done. Thanks all very much. Really appreciate it. I really appreciate it. I have enjoyed this immensely. This is maybe my favorite of the 107. So, thank you all very much. Congratulations to Robert. Congratulations to Dan, and we will be in touch. Thanks again.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are on a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.\nDan Cravens: Thanks, Sara (ph). Good morning, everyone and welcome to the American Airlines Group Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call this morning, we have Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President, and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call on the line as well for Q&A session are several of our senior execs, including Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Global Engagement and Vasu Raja, our Chief Revenue Officer. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and we'll update that to the actions we've taken during the pandemic. Robert will then follow some remarks about our operations, commercial, and other strategic initiatives.  After Robert's remarks, Derek will follow with details on the quarter and our operating plans going forward. After Derek 's comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions, and lastly, questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, cost, forecasts of capacity, and fleet plan.  These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found on our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30th, 2021. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items.  A reconciliation of those GAAP numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found in the Investor Relations section on our website. A webcast of this call will also be available on the website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the materials subsequently. Thanks again for joining us at this point. I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Dan, and thank you-all for being with us. Good morning. Our third quarter started out very strong. Our domestic business revenue, which declined from 27% of our 2019 levels in March to 52% in June jumped even more in July, actually jumped to 64%, as companies began to return to work and employees began to return to the skies. As a result, we in American produce our profit in the month of July. But then the spread of Delta variant led to a rebound in pandemic fears, of course, companies deferred return to work plans, and that domestic revenue, the rest of business revenues fell back to 57% of 2019 in August and 47% in September. Now, I know some people will find that kind of discouraging, but we actually think it's encouraging. Despite in business revenue in the month of July, it showed that business travel does want to return.  There was enormous pent up demand and once this pandemic behind us, it should resume its prior rapid trajectory to recover. As to how it all gets reflected in the financial results, that profit in July, followed by larger losses in August and September, added up to a cumulative loss. On a GAAP basis, we actually reported a net profit of $169 million. When we exclude net special items, we recorded a net loss of $641 million. While we obviously don't like reporting losses, this is our smallest quarterly loss since the pandemic began in early 2020. [Indiscernible] is how well the American Airlines team is performing.  No one is managing through this pandemic and into the recovery better than people in American, that shows in the results. At a time when airlines are struggling to build back service and respond to demand, no one has dealt back further and faster than American. We flew greater than 80% of our 2019 capacity in the third quarter, where our large competitors have restored only 70%. As a result, we flew 13% more seat miles in the quarter than our next closest competitor. Our team safely transporting more than 48 million passengers in the quarter. Our team did this [Indiscernible] an excellent job of taking care of our customers. We struggled with growth ourselves as we entered the quarter.  But we responded quickly and aggressively. We ended the quarter flying by far the largest airline in the world with the best September operational performance in American history. Great performance by our team has led to a strong customer acceptance, as evidenced by our industry-leading passenger counts and our revenue trends. For the quarter, revenues were significantly improved over 2020, and we're down 25% in the third quarter versus the same compared to 2019, whereas they were down 37.5% in the second quarter on the same year over 2 year basis. Notably, our passenger unit revenues in the quarter were down 10% versus 2019, versus 12% declines that the other large international US carriers, despite our higher capacity production. On the cost front, we've reshaped our network, simplified our fleet, and built operational cost efficiencies into the business that will serve us well for years to come. We accelerated the retirement of more than 150 older aircraft, and American continues to operate the youngest, the most fuel-efficient fleet of the US network carriers. Importantly, we've action more than $1.3 billion of permanent annual cost reductions into the business through our green flag initiatives. As we've navigated through the crisis, we've been careful to think and look long-term.  We've announced a series of strategic relationships with other airlines around the world that strengthen the American network and the additional utilities to our customers and long-term value for our shareholders. The most notable of these are our Northeast alliance with JetBlue and our West Coast international alliance with Alaska, which we continue to implement and grow in the third quarter. Looking forward, we feel great about where American is positioned. Due to deferred business demand and the recent rise in fuel prices, the fourth quarter will be challenging. But that's a near-term issue finding a longer-term [Indiscernible]  We're encouraged by the upside that exists in demand for business and international travel, and our confidence is reinforced by the incredible work the American Airlines team has done throughout this pandemic and continues to do today. We're particularly excited about the future that lies ahead for American and our team. With that, I'll turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Doug and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the entire American Airlines team for their efforts to the third quarter and throughout the pandemic. Our airline continues to succeed, thanks to the hard work of our team. As Doug mentioned, this summer represented the largest operational ramp-up in the history of American. As we built back the operation, much like other businesses, we've managed through supply chain constraints, vendor and staffing challenges, constantly changing travel restrictions, and a lot more. Through it all, we operate more flights and carried more customers in any other US Airlines. More than tripling our daily departures from May 2020, which is the low [Indiscernible] of our schedule and we're pleased with where we are.  American recorded our most reliable September since the merger, based on completion factor, on-time departures, and on-time arrivals. We'll continue to focus at delivering a safe and reliable operations, and continuing the momentum as we further scale our operation, and welcome back even more customers. I also want to acknowledge the efforts of the American team in third quarter in support of the US Civil Reserve Air Fleet program. It was a tremendous honor for American to aid in the effort to bring more than 5,000 evacuees from Afghanistan to the US, as well as hundreds of members of the US military.  That work included working with the Customs and Border Protection to open up the Philadelphia facilities as a welcoming center for foreign nationals. We're grateful to our team members throughout the airline, and from all over the world who came together to support American's craft activation. As we reported this morning, our third quarter total revenue was approximately 9 billion, up 1.5 billion from the second quarter. This improvement was driven by our passenger revenue recovery, which increased by more than 20% sequentially from the second quarter on a 12% increase in available seat miles. Overall, half of the revenue in the third quarter was 72% of what it was in the third quarter of 2019, which is up 13% sequentially in the second quarter. Domestic leisure revenue has now returned to pre-pandemic levels at 98%, 2019 levels in the third quarter.  As Doug described, business revenue growth stalled in the quarter and finish flat in the second quarter at around 50% of 2019 levels. Given recent booking trends with a Delta variant in the society and everything we're seeing, hearing from our customers, we're applying for a robust peak travel period with fourth quarter, and we're excited about prospects for 2022 and here's why. We expect the domestic leisure revenues will surpass 2019 levels in the fourth quarter and continue to that trends throughout 2022. Short-haul international revenues should follow that same pattern. Recent trends showed that corporate bookings month-to-date have improved significantly and are accelerating like they were earlier in the year before the Delta variant and associated restrictions were imposed. Our largest corporate customers staff will be returning to work fully to the office and travel as we move out of 2021.  Because of that, we continue to expect a full rebound of business revenue to 2019 levels on a monthly basis by the end of 2022. Speaking right away with our top corporate customers, almost all have resumed domestic US business travel to some extent. As companies return to the office and lift travel restrictions, we see continued growth in corporate travel. Industrials, healthcare, and professional services continue to lead that recovery. Long-haul international travel, particularly long-haul business travel, were the first to return to starting to come back. Right now, almost two-thirds of our corporate customers are traveling internationally for at least essential business.  We expect international travel to improve significantly with easing of cross-border requirements and are encouraged by the recent views about the US government easing international travel [Indiscernible] and entry restrictions starting in November. Following the White House announcement, we saw an immediate increase in bookings in several of our key international markets. Overnight, we saw a 66% increase in bookings to the UK, a 40% increase to [Indiscernible], and a 74% increase to Brazil. Clearly, there's significant pent up demand for travel to and from the US and many customers are eager to return to travel when it's permitted.  Just focusing on the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue will recover to approximately 80%, 2019 levels, up approximately five points sequentially versus the third quarter, with the strongest performance in domestic and short-haul international markets. We continue to make significant strides in building [Indiscernible] global network in the industry and reconnecting with our customers. Our partnerships with JetBlue and Alaska are delivering tremendous benefits for customers and enabling new [Indiscernible] that otherwise wouldn't be possible. When 715,000 customers were able to travel across our networks during the quarter, thanks to these innovative partnerships. Together, American and JetBlue will operate more than 700 daily flights from New York and Boston this winter, including nearly 50 international destinations out of JFK. We also continue to create a seamless experience for our customers, including rolling out Reciprocal Elite benefits for AAdvantage and TrueBlue Mosaic members, and we expect to launch mileage reduction on JetBlue very soon.  Our loyalty program continues to demonstrate its attractiveness to our customers and partners. Remember, acquisitions in the third quarter exceeded 2019 levels, despite the airline flying a significantly smaller schedule. As our customers continue to engage with AAdvantage, our co-brand cash payments were essentially fully recovered at 96% in the third quarter versus the same period in 2019. This was up from just 78% in the second quarter on the same basis. We expect this trend to continue as the network returns to a more normalized level. At [Indiscernible] front.  During the quarter, American became the first North American airlines to commit to developing a science-based target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. We also agreed to turn to purchase more carbon-neutral, sustainable aviation fuel. American also became an [Indiscernible] partner to breakthrough energy catalyst and we're committed to invest $100 million and a groundbreaking collaborative effort to accelerate the Clean Energy Technologies necessary for achieving a net zero economy by 2050.  We're excited about this work and what it will mean for the future of aviation and acceleration and adoption of critical next-generation clean technologies across all industries. So in summary, while the Delta variant has shifted the timeline for the recovery, we remain very bullish on the return of demand and we feel great about how we're positioned thanks to the hard work and dedication of American Airlines team. With that, I'll turn it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Robert. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I would also like to thank the American Airlines team for their hard work during the quarters. Their continued resilience in the face of uncertainty due to the Delta variant is commendable. This morning, we reported the third quarter GAAP net profit of $169 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $641 million or a loss of $0.99 per share. As Doug mentioned in his remarks, this was our strongest quarter since the pandemic began. As we have discussed in the past, as we always expected, the recovery would be unpredictable and our third quarter results reflect this. Despite the Delta variant related volatility and demand and revenue trends that Robert discussed, our financial performance improved from the second quarter, but fell short of our initial expectations that we outlined in our last earnings call.  While the slow down in demand was clearly disappointing, it is important to note that the trajectory of our results continues to be positive. In fact, even with the drop-off in bookings from the Delta variant and rising oil prices, our third quarter pre-tax earnings, excluding net special items improved by nearly 600 million sequentially versus the second quarter. This makes it even clear to us that the steps we are taking over the past 18 months are working. As we have navigated the pandemic, we built back our network in a way that we'd keep our capacity aligned with demand, while giving us the ability to be flexible as conditions change.  We've have also worked to keep our controllable costs down, and have action 1.3 billion in permanent annual cost initiatives this year alone. Based on our results, it's clear these actions are paying off, as our third quarter CASM, including fuel and net special items was up just 10.5% versus the same period in 2019, despite flying approximately 20% less capacity. On the fleet side, we moved swiftly to retire older aircraft and accelerate our fleet harmonization project. Our 737 Retrofit program was completed in May, and we continue to expect our A321 aircraft to be complete by early next year, a full year ahead of our original schedule.  In addition to the customer benefits of larger overhead bins, in-seat power, and streaming in-flight entertainment, these aircraft will generate more revenue and allow us to connect more customers over our network. They will also provide a unit cost tailwind as we build back our network. With respect to our wide-body aircraft, we continue to work with Boeing to finalize the timing of our delayed 787-8 deliveries, that were expected to arrive in 2021. In the meantime, due to the continued uncertainty in the delivery schedule, we have proactively remove these aircrafts from our winter schedule to minimize potential passenger disruption. I'd also like to note that these delays have had an impact on our fourth quarter CASM since we built the cost structure to fly these aircraft during the fourth quarter.  We ended the quarter with approximately 18 billion of total available liquidity, which reflects the 950 million in prepayment of our spare parts term loan made in July, and approximately 649 million of scheduled debt payments made during the quarter. The scheduled debt paydown unencumbered 20 Boeing 777 aircraft. Further, in our unencumbered asset based to 3.8 billion and our first lien capacity to more than 8.4 billion. We look ahead, we feel confident with our -- we have enough liquidity to allow American to navigate the choppiness of the recovery.  Because of this choppiness, we will continue to keep liquidity at elevated levels in the near to medium-term, with a plan to step down our target liquidity to approximately 10 to 12 billion at some point next year, when we are confident the recovery has taken hold, and we have returned to sustain profitability. The deleveraging of American's balance sheet remains a priority and we are committed to significant, steady and continuous debt reduction in the years ahead. Even with a slower than expected recovery observed during the third quarter, we remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025.  Ten billion of this will be achieved through amortization of debt and its net of new financing. Importantly, these debt reduction targets are based on a plan that assumes future deliveries are financed. Should we elect to use cash in lieu of financing aircraft, that decision would contribute to de-leveraging and further accelerate the timeline to achieve these targets. Of the incremental 5 billion, nearly 1 billion has already been actioned, with a prepayment of the spare parts term low we announced on the last call. As we look ahead, we will continue to focus our efforts on pre-payable debt, which currently represents approximately 30% of our total debt obligations. In addition to deleveraging our balance sheet, this plan will allow us to smooth our near-term maturity towers and free up high-quality collateral. Assuming this level of debt reduction and continued margin improvement, our plan is targeted to result in the best credit metrics in the history of post-merger American by the end of a four-year period. Looking into the fourth quarter, the delay in the return of corporate travel and rising fuel prices will put pressure on our margins relative to the third quarter. We expect our capacity to be down approximately 11% to 13% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.  Based on current demand assumptions and capacity plans, we continue to expect the slight sequential increase in our revenues, and expect total revenues to be down approximately 20% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. In total, we expect a pre-tax margin, excluding net special items of between negative 16% and negative 18%. For the full-year our projected debt principal payments are expected to be 4.4 billion. This includes the 750 million payment of spare parts term loan, and the 550 million prepayment of the term loan with US Treasury that was completed earlier this year. We have 612 million scheduled debt principal payments in the fourth quarter. With respect to capital expenditures, we expect full year 2021 CapEx to remain minimal with non-aircraft CapEx at approximately 900 million and net aircraft CapEx, including pre-delivery payments remaining an inflow of 900 million.  We are still in the early stages of building our operating plans for 2022, and we'll have more to say on what our capacity and cost outlook will look like on our next earnings call. But at an eye level, based on the demand trends we see today, along with the feedback from our corporate customers, we expect to slowly increase our capacity throughout the year and to have a full year capacity very near 2019 levels. [Indiscernible] is subject to the future demand environment and we will always retain the ability to adapt if demand conditions warrant.  Lastly, I know a lot of investors are concerned about inflationary pressure in 2022 and beyond, we'll know more once we finalize our 2022 budget, but we do see pressures in fuel prices, hiring and training for both new hires and existing crews as we ramp up our operations, including on the regional side, where we recently announced the pilot retention program. We are also seeing increased starting wages for certain regional groups, including vendors. Even with these pressures, our fleet simplification strategy enables higher aircraft utilization and higher average gauge, both of which will help offset some of these unit cost pressures.  As I said earlier, we will share more specific details on these impacts to our cost structure as our 2022 plan on our next earnings call in January. So in conclusion, our team continues to do an amazing job of managing through the uncertainty, maintaining a strong liquidity position, and driving efficiencies throughout the organization. And we are well-positioned for the future. So with that, I will open up the line for analysts questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. So Doug, I think it was like three or four years ago, you had a slide at our conference. It was entitled, There, They Go Again. It was a list of airline behaviors that you were warning investors to keep an eye out for -- it was a cool slide, actually. So two bullets on that stood out: expanding service to markets that don't touch a hub, and establishing new hubs. Could you help frame the Seattle expansion against that slide? It's not like the slide was written in stone and you carried it down from Mt. Sinai or anything. I'm just having trouble reconciling it in the current environment.\nDoug Parker: Sure. I'll do it at a high level and [Indiscernible] could chime in with more details if you'd like, Jamie. So, yeah, look, that's not a new hub, as you [Indiscernible] there's all ready a hub there, it's Alaska's, they're our partner and we're simply making net health stronger by having alliance with Alaska, whereby we can do things they can't do or they wouldn't be able to do without investment. That wouldn't make sense. By flying international because we have international aircraft and they can do things that we can't do just be in those flights with their already existing Seattle hub. So it's not a new hub [Indiscernible] to note that hasn't happened since we put that [Indiscernible] .\nVasu Rajar: Yes, and James. This is Vasu. I'll add to that. Actually, we see Seattle as being really actually consistent with that. [Indiscernible] it's pretty simple that we go create value for customers by being relevant and being relevant, the biggest markets and in a way to go create a legitimate, valuable, and profitable international network, we need to be able to launch flights for international markets.  [Indiscernible] historically, in the West Coast, we've had a very, very small presence. Most namely in the Pacific Northwest where we've had almost no presence. With this, which is a very creative deal. What we're doing is we're flying things like Seattle to [Indiscernible] or Seattle to [Indiscernible] all of which feed off of that huge global market that Alaska has cultivated. It draws from the connectivity of the Seattle hub.  We've been really encouraged with the results, not just across the West Coast, but really across the system. Alaska Airlines is increasingly emerging as one of, if not our largest codeshare partner. We are seeing a huge customer benefit all up and down the West Coast. Actually, as we look at it, we're creating close to about 300,000 customers are now able to experience AA or Alaska where before they had no competitive option or they had one or two competitive options in the marketplace and the market is responding.  We've set records for AAdvantage enrollments, but the two markets where our enrollments are growing the most are all the markets in the West Coast partnership, everything from San Diego, North of Seattle, and the other ones are New York and Boston. So we see as actually to be really consistent in a really effective and wise way to go and develop a level of network comprehensiveness that will be too impossible to do.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That's really helpful. And then a follow-up, this one, a quick one on fuel, maybe for Robert or Derek. The question I repeatedly receive is why haven't managements adjusted capacity to account for $2.50 jet kero. I know you can't speak for the industry, but for American, is there a certain period of time that you need to be convinced that higher fuel is going to be sustained? Is there too much uncertainty around 2022 revenue to be making capacity decisions today? Just looking for some color on how you would answer the question that I'm getting every day, and I imagine my competitors are as well. Thanks in advance.\nDoug Parker: Jamie, I'll go first, all because you and I have been doing this a long time. When oil price move this quick, it's really hard to have responses of what happened here. It's run up very quickly. We're already selling all the capacities out there. So what I know is, what I believe is and this has been the history of our business, if in the new normal, you will see adjustments, you will see adjustments in capacity, which will result in changes in pricing. This don't happen that quickly. It also takes a while for anyone to come to the conclusion that this is real. But 2014 was a pretty good year in the airline business, and Brent averaged 100 bucks [Indiscernible] . This is, you know it will adapt if this is the new normal. But right now, in the very near-term, it's hard to adapt. Robert?\nRobert Isom: This will come into balance and fuel prices run up very, very quickly. As we take a look of things, there must be an impact on capacity and pricing in the long run.\nJamie Baker: Got it. Thank you. All three of you, take care.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Cunningham with MKM Partners. Your line is now open.\nConnor Cunningham: Hi everyone. Thanks for the time.\nDoug Parker: Hey, Connor.\nConnor Cunningham: Hi. When listening to Delta and United's call, a huge portion of their script is about premium products and how they think there's a structural change happening. I don't think you guys mentioned much about that. I was wondering if you could just speak to how your different products are performing right now and do you actually agree that there's structural changes happening where leisure travelers are trying to book up more towards premium seats?\nVasu Rajar: Hey, Connor. This is Vasu. I can start that one and others may chime in. Look, we certainly as most definitely see a change where there are customers who are much more willing to buy premium than before. Indeed, our premium revenue across our domestic system for much of the quarter was actually higher than what it was in 2019, which is pretty promising. But we spend lot of time looking at this. There's a component of it which certainly seems very promising, but still seems early to say whether this thing is structural or not. At least in our own system, we took a lot of [Indiscernible] out of international flight and we deployed them into domestic.  We were really encouraged by what we saw, where there are a lot of customers with a lot more disposable incomes who would travel on leisure trip and they would not only pay for the lie-flat product, they pay a premium versus other non-lie products in the marketplace. That's certainly been an encouraging thing. But what we don't know is it's so much of that trip behavior also. It was people leaving on a Thursday coming back on Monday. So we do think that with more disposable income, there will be some interest in the consumer to have more experiences, to pay more for those experiences.  What we don't know is how to size the magnitude of it. Because there's a lot of things that certainly speaking for American Airlines that was very unique for the last several months. And we don't yet know how much of a structural change that is, but to the early point of the beauty of the airline and we've -- this pandemic has proved over and over again, is that we can change where the airplanes go very, very quickly. And with that, we can also change the product design pretty quickly too. This is something that we're looking at. It is a similar trend that we're seeing. Time will tell how structural it is though.\nRobert Isom: Thanks Vasu. And to understand, hey, look, we're ready for what we've been preparing for a long time, not just in selling product which Vasu has talked about but the hard products as well. So the fleet is ready from a cabin configuration perspective, whether that's business class cabins or premium [Indiscernible] that we put in [Indiscernible] wide bodies. And then just as we look at travel recovery, in ways to service, you're going to see that we're adding back amenities that will allow us to sell and bundle in different ways. Everything from our 5-star service that this come back to the opening of our flagship lounges, which are our best in the industry. We have a way to sell into service, every customer, every end of the spectrum in terms of demand, so we feel really good about how we're set up to whatever environment that we find ourselves in.\nConnor Cunningham: Appreciate it. And then just on the cost structure, I mean, investors are trying to get comfortable with different stories on the cost side for the airlines, in general. So I mean clearly inflationary pressures, but curious, if you can talk to any of the tailwinds that you might be having that happened in 2022 outside of bringing back capacity to 2019 levels. The reason why I ask is I would've thought given some of the structural changes you had within fleet simplification and so on that 4Q would have had a little bit more leverage to it. So any details would be helpful.\nDerek Kerr: Yes, Connor, in the fourth quarter, I mean, the story and I touched a little bit about here is we built the airlines to fly more in the fourth quarter without a doubt, now two of the issues. One is the Boeing 787-8, which are not here. We had assumed they we're going to be in this schedule. So we have 787 pilots, we have crews ready to fly those aircraft, but we unfortunately had to pull them out of the schedule in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. The other thing from a capacity perspective that we're all dealing with right now is on the regional side.  As pilot supportability on the regional side, which will resolve itself over time. But as the mainline is hiring up, a lot of places they go to get pilots is on the regionals, so we're probably not flying as much regional as we would have flown. So I think from a CASM perspective that's what drove it a little bit higher in the fourth-quarter without a doubt versus where we had planned. So we're -- we're not flying exactly what we would have flown and where we already got in the cost structures there.  As we go forward, the tailwinds are really, I mean, the $1.3 billion worth of cost reductions is permanent, it's going to be in there. As we look into next year, we haven't done the plan yet, so that's why it's really hard for me to give any kind of guide on a CASM for next year. We do see these inflationary hits to mostly from a salary perspective, a vendor perspective, those kind of things, and fuel as I talked about, that will have to overcome as we look at the plan for next year and we'll do that as we dig through the process. But we'll have the tailwinds, the cost coming out that we did from an efficiency standpoint, and also the number one, getting out of the aircraft types and modifying the aircraft to be the same all across from the Oasis Project will benefit us a lot as we go into 2022.\nDoug Parker: Connor, just because we haven't talked, we didn't spend a lot of time talking about the 1.3 billion [Indiscernible] which is for others who may have [Indiscernible] closely, those are real, they're in the airline. When we look at this as we go back to fly the 2019 schedule today, [Indiscernible] that amount. It's combination and it's a lot of things, but the largest ones are $500 million or so in management, payroll and as Derek said, all the efficiencies you get from [Indiscernible] fleets, training and otherwise. So those are the tailwinds to offset inflationary pressures that's Derek is talking about.\nConnor Cunningham: Okay. Appreciate it.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Connor.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu : Hi. Good morning, and thank you for the time, guys. Maybe if we could talk about the transatlantic market. It begun to open up a little bit more and maybe heading into 2022, but your passenger revenues are still down about 75%. How do you think about the cadence of that recovery?\nRobert Isom: Hey, this is Vasu. I can take that one. We've been really encouraged by what we've seen over the last, let's call it, 3 or 4 weeks, [Indiscernible] international at large, but especially at transatlantic. Certainly, after the regulatory restrictions changed, we saw a big spike in bookings in the 2 or 3 days after it. But what -- which is not that surprising. What's been more encouraging to us is that it really sustained itself. But what we are seeing out there -- what you see from us right now as a little bit of cautious optimism. In November and December, we are absolutely seeing bookings coming in at a greater rate than what we saw in 2019.  A lot of that though is pent up demand effect. As we get into next year with every passing week, we see our bookings step up more and more across transatlantic. And so we're really encouraged by that. But the big variable will be when corporate starts to returning back at office and start traveling again for business which we anticipate being more in the Q1 timeframe than in the Q4 timeframe. Follow more so for us where our transatlantic network is really concentrated around London. So we don't anticipate as much of a business recovery in Q4, but we are seeing a really, really mean for leisure recovery.  And all the more so as British Airways builds back as connecting schedule, in Heathrow, we anticipated picking an increasing amount of demand as Q4 goes along. So you see that number in aggregate, we see that something is changing a lot from where we are on October to November to January and beyond.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thanks a lot, Vasu.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nDavid Vernon: Thanks, Operator, and thanks guys for taking the question. Doug and Robert, we sat down a little bit before the pandemic and you had laid out a picture where American had been lagging on some of the customer-facing and information technology stuff that was kind of constraining the operation in ways like not letting you book up to a higher load factor because of the designed boarding practice, the ability to pay for upgrades, dynamic pricing on [Indiscernible] tickets, all that stuff. A lot of it sounded like IT-driven initiatives. And I was wondering coming out of the crisis as we start to look out over the next couple of years, is there still catch-up work you need to do to bring yourself at parity with peers in terms of the way they are monetizing capacity or are you kind of close that gap through this crisis?\nMaya Leibman: Steve. Hi, this is Maya. And I'm proud to say that over the last several years, we really have close the gap on a number of our technology initiatives, including some of the ones that you've [Indiscernible] up like dynamic pricing and allowing subs, higher [Indiscernible] and a lot of standby on safe departure activity. We've really used the pandemic as an opportunity to really identify those gaps and to close them and really focused on a lot of the other things that we've been talking about that we will be tailwinds for next year like our [Indiscernible] partnerships, and making a better customer experience for our customers with our West Coast and Northeast alliances.\nDavid Vernon: Is there a way to frame what that outlook like be in terms of load factor or sort of ancillary revenue growth, it looks like the other revenue lines performing pretty well. But is there a way to kind of put a number around some of these things?\nVasu Rajar: Hey, this is Vasu. We're in early stages of doing that as we build next year's plan but probably our top-line initiative is making sure that all of these partnerships are really integrated and seamless for the customer. A lot of the longstanding issues that have existed in co-sharing relationships really get alleviated pretty quickly. And a little bit -- we're pretty pleased with that. We've made a lot of progress with the Alaska and JetBlue, and what we're seeing is very encouraging.  To my earlier comments, we're seeing a lot of customers come in and a meaningful amount of revenue production that there too. As we looked at in Q3, it was a massive benefit to customers. We estimated benefit and about a half percentage point of system revenue, but something which is a lot more meaningful to New York and Boston and West Coast network which was operating at 50% historical level. So we think there's a lot of uplift to the whole thing without a lot of investments, further.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Mckenzie with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.\nDan Mckenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. The first question here is just a housekeeping question from a prior question, the Oasis Project. Is that included in the 1.3 billion of structural cost savings or is that above and beyond? And then just related to that, if that had been fully implemented in 2019, how much would that have contributed to pre-tax income?\nDerek Kerr: Yes, it is included. It added more seats in some of the aircraft. And from an operational benefit, it will help out a lot because as we swap the aircraft, they will both be in that. So it is in that because we reduced the aircraft types, but it's included in that number. What it's going to do is benefit number 1, from a CASM perspective because we'll have more seats, and from a revenue perspective because we'll be able to sell more seats.\nDan Mckenzie: Yeah. Understood. Okay. Second question here. What is the aggregate wallet spend, say a fortune with 1,000 accounts in the Northeast that American can now access for the first time as a result of the Northeast Alliance. So accounts that really where you had no shot at winning, free the relationship with JetBlue versus now, you walk in, you sit down with the corporate travel managers. You can actually put together a competitive network solution and then just related to that potential aggregate spend, what would American's fair share and American JetBlue's fair share be of that?\nVasu Rajar: Hey, Dan, this is Vasu. Thanks for the question. I appreciate what you're trying to get out of it, which is effectively how much more market can we access than what American could access on it's own. And while -- I don't have specific numbers in some cases, but we got to be a little bit careful in what we share about it. As we see it, in New York historically, we might have been at 25% player, but we were competing for something which was actually like 10% to 15% of the available business travel market at large, not just the corporate market. So in large part because we had a really great product in Heathrow or in the transcom markets, if we couldn't get you very effectively to Toronto, at some point customers, especially larger accounts or power travelers, business top customers, just stop flying us.  Now as we see it, we have the best network between AA and JetBlue. We've come from a world where we have four trips a day JFK, San Francisco, one we're we'll have 12, 13, 14 trips a day where all of our transcom product is full flat. We've taken a 50-seat RJ out of New York altogether. So when you think about New York, it's a business travel market which is not 2 or 3 times larger than the next biggest market, but several orders of magnitude more than that and that's all out of the market that we get to compete for and compete where we see a New York who's [Indiscernible] instead of under-performing the system by 10% to 15%, can perform in line with the system.\nRobert Isom: Hey, Dan, I just wanted to go back and just to add one more point regarding the fleet harmonization project, which we're almost done with. We only have I think 60 of the 321s that are remaining and will be completed by the first quarter. Derek mentioned that in the 1.3 billion, so much of the savings in terms of actual commonality and what we can take out in terms of reduction of fleet side is the day of back rate, the airline more efficient. That's included in the 1.3 billion. What's not, though, is we are having seats. So, that has very, very low marginal cost. So growth from a 160 seats on [Indiscernible], and then on an average, adding a few seats to the 321 as well. That's benefits that will be seen in run rates going forward.\nDan Mckenzie: That actually was my question --\nRobert Isom: From a revenue perspective.\nDan Mckenzie: Yeah, the incremental revenue that you gave, that was actually my question, was that's what -- that's what I was trying to get at. But thanks for the time you guys.\nDoug Parker: Thanks Dan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent with Citi. Your line is now open.\nStephen Trent: Good morning, gentlemen, and thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick one on looking at your investment. So you guys committed to invest in Jet Smart and Goal and South America. You of course have this tie-up with JetBlue in the United States. When you think about other international [Indiscernible] . Do you see any opportunities for the similar kinds of tie-ups, for example, outside of the Oneworld Alliance?\nVasu Rajar: Hey, this is Vasu, Stephen. I can start on that one. Look, ultimately, what we wanted to do is to create the most comprehensive network for our customers and whether it is a codeshare, an investment, the joint venture, whatever it is, we don't see them in ends in themselves. Those are just simply means through which we can create something really comprehensive for our customers. In many parts of the world, we want to be able to do it all just organically with American Airlines [Indiscernible] that's not always possible from regulatory or other reasons. So based on that, we employ different mechanics, whether it is in an investment, a codeshare, a loyalty partnership, until it will change out there.  But for us, the [Indiscernible] is creating this comprehensive global network and we see that. Whether it's -- we've seen the benefits of it for consumers in the Northeast and the West Coast. As we look at South America, really it has less to do with investments and more that the one thing we can't do for the South American customer is carry them within South America. So we are always on the lookout for partners that can help us do that and create more value for the customer. How we go in partnerships together is a second order issue.\nStephen Trent: I appreciate it, Vasu. And just one very quick follow-up. How are you guys thinking longer term about your pipeline of pilots and when you think about retirement in the next 5 to 7 years and what have you?\nRobert Isom: Stephen, I'll take that one. Our profession has never been a better time to get into it. And what I will tell you is we can -- we will attract people to the profession given the kind of starting salaries that we're offering right now. And ultimately, at what pilots top out at. So I do see this ultimately an economic issues that will be solved. You've seen us do some things recently with regional pilots to make sure that they stay in position and progress onto American Airlines and we will continue to monitor that over time, as we saw a few years back, this will be brought into balance simply based on economics. People will want to come into the profession.\nStephen Trent: Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Delhopeles with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.\nChris Delhopeles: Thank you and thanks for taking my question. Good morning. So on headcount, how should we think about FTEs in 2022 and if possible 2023? Could you run your network at or above 2019 capacity on fewer FTEs relative to 2019?\nDerek Kerr: Yeah. I think -- I mean, we have taken out a significant amount of headcount out of the Company that's part -- that's mostly what the $1.3 billion of cost reductions, permanent cost reductions are. As Doug alluded to, 500 of that is management headcounts, 600 of it is productivity at the other areas throughout the Company. So yes, we will run -- I don't have a number for the 2022 plan because we haven't put that together yet, but that is the significant portion of what that $1.3 billion worth of permanent cost reductions are, it's mostly in the headcount and the personnel side of things at American Airlines.\nChris Delhopeles: Okay and the second question on the corporate side. So you mentioned a full recovery by year-end 2022. Just curious with the mix of users is here. I know you mentioned industrial, healthcare and I think one other group, but are your surveys showing a mix similar to pre-pandemic travel or is it shifted and is your outlook contemplating the same type of travel, meaning both in user type and frequency? Thanks.\nVasu Rajar: This is Vasu and I can help with that. Look, our -- we see you're exactly right. Certain industries and verticals are traveling more than others. We do anticipate there being a rebound across all of them because at this point, all industry verticals are improving. There are just different points in the improvement curve. More critically and more importantly to your question, what we see is that even in sectors where travel is less back, the rate of progress we're seeing is mirroring those sectors where travel is relatively more returned. So we do have some real confidence that indeed corporate travel is likely to come back.  As Doug and Robert mentioned earlier in their remarks, there is an immense amount of pent up demand. And we find that once people start to travel, they continue to do so. Very importantly, though, for us and our system, we have a lot of -- a lot of our business style demand is small and medium-sized business, really across the Southeast and the Southwest and we're seeing on a traffic basis, that is very well recovered on the revenue basis. That will start to recover as people come back and have more flights, more frankly.\nRobert Isom: Hey, Vasu. I'll add this, Alison Taylor just held our corporate customer advisory board down in Miami. I was able to attend as well for a part of it, and that brings together our top 50 corporate customers and those that are responsible for procurement of travel at those companies. I'm really pleased to hear just over and over again about, look, we have to get back to the office. Once we get back to the office, travel is going to come. So it's not surprising that the industrials and healthcare pharmaceuticals are leading us right now. They're back in the office. They've got to take care of us and put food on the table. That's happening, what's going to come next is some of the other banking and financial services, entertainment, as those get back into the office in the start of the new year, they're going to come back to just as we're seeing in some of these other sectors.\nDoug Parker: Hey, Chris, it's Doug. Just being around just to support some of what Robert just told you. I talked about how in July we were up to 64% of our 2019 levels in terms of business revenue. There's a big difference between large companies, those that we have on corporate discount programs, and our small and medium business. In that 54%, the large corporates are 35% on a year-to-year basis, and the small and medium businesses at 83%. So [Indiscernible] people that are back at work are traveling.  When the large corporates get back to work, they'll travel. It's less about sectors, more about people just getting comfortable, bringing people back to the office. Those companies that don't have large headquarters and large HR departments are out flying because they need to across all sectors. Those companies that are large organizations and need to worry about those things more aren't yet back. They were starting to come back. But they'll get up under the same ranges. That's where business wants to be.\nChris Delhopeles: Great color. Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker : Hi, everybody. I hope you are all doing well.\nDoug Parker: We are, Helane. How are you?\nHelane Becker : I'm okay. I guess I'll see you tomorrow night. By the way, congratulations.\nDoug Parker: Oh, thank you.\nHelane Becker : Here's my question really for Derek. Interest expense, I think in the third quarter was $476 million, I want to say. Can you just talk about debt pay down and the cadence of that and how it's going to look over the next couple of years in that context of you're going from 15 billion, I think you've said in the press release, $15 billion of debt paydown by 2025.\nDerek Kerr: Yeah. Well, I can give you what our scheduled debt paydowns are over the next few years. So, we said we're going to pay down $4.4 billion this year. Next year is $2.5 billion, the year after that, I will just say it's around $3 billion to $3.5 billion each year as you go forward. So -- but we will -- but we do plan, just as I talked about on the call, we do plan on financing aircraft in this environment going forward. So the net debt will be a little bit different than that. So the 10 billion will come off, let's just So, call it 2 billion a year over the next 5 years. That will reduce that. What we do on the other 5, we had talked about 1 billion already went at -- in 2021, so we did the paydown of the spare parts loan.  We also, because of the recovery, slowed a little bit. We're going to hold on to cash and hold on to cash where we're at today. Once we feel we're comfortable with that, I think we will quickly use the excess cash to pay off most of the remaining 4 billion. It just depends on where our cash balances. It depends on how it will grow over time. But I would expect it to be sooner than later, as long as the recovery happens, business comes back, and the earnings are there to do that. So, the prepayment would be upfront, the debt pay down over time, that $10 billion will be over gradually over time.  I don't think we have any big -- huge debt payments. There's a $750 million one in 2022 that we have nothing huge going forward. So I wouldn't look at it that way is pretty ratably the 10 billion over the next four years. Then we would try to attack the other four billion as soon as we feel comfortable and have excess cash that we can take it down to that 10 to 12 billion. We're at 18 today. So we would most likely do it early, or as I said in the comments, we could use cash to pay for aircraft and just not add the debt instead of paying off any pre-payable debt. So that's the plan that we have today.\nHelane Becker : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Then on the 787 I think those were going to be leased in aircraft from [Indiscernible] does the delays changed any of the financing arrangements for those aircraft?\nDerek Kerr: No, it does not change the financing of the aircraft, still leased-in.\nHelane Becker : Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning. Question for Doug. I thought it was interesting in the prepared comments that more capacity versus peers and more revenue versus peers was called out. Is that the main goal of the Company at this point, more revenue or do relative margins matter? To what extent is profitability a priority for the Board at all? Or does it not even come up in conversations given how high liquidity is? What is the Board trying to solve for?\nDoug Parker: For relative margins, Duane. We feel really good about that. The reason I talked so much about the absolute growth at this point in time is because we're all working to add back capacity and to get to where we can meet the demand [Indiscernible] . I'm really proud of what the team's done to get back more capacity than others, take care of more customers than others, and to do so, obviously safely and efficiently, and to do so in a way that [Indiscernible] pre-operation right now. Of course, that's not the goal of the Company. It's just [Indiscernible], the goal of the Company is to maximize shareholder value over the long term, and the way we'll do that is producing returns and what we feel very good about is our ability as we come out of this to improve our relative margins certainly versus, I think probably versus everybody, as you compare them back to 2019 or other years.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just a quick housekeeping and I appreciate you taking the questions. Just looking into the fourth quarter, do you expect the operating cash burn to be larger than the 1.7 billion burn in 3Q? I'm not sure if you have the call, but can you speak to the daily cash burn estimate? Are we going to head back to there? Thanks for taking the questions.\nDerek Kerr: We -- go ahead.\nDoug Parker: No, please.\nDerek Kerr: No, were are not heading back there. The fourth quarter is the season -- seasonally, you do burn cash in the fourth quarter.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I hear you, but I go back through every fourth quarter since you guys merged, and there's no negative operating cash burn. Understand revenue is depressed, fuel's a little bit higher, but operating cash flow is typically positive in the fourth quarter.\nDoug Parker: Operating cash flow, but the seasonality does in profitable years has cash declining [Indiscernible] that operational cash flow will track with the earnings estimate that Derek gave.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you for taking the questions.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Duane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. So as American keeps ramping up capacity and maybe a little bit -- little bit quicker than your network peers and with your vaccine mandate upcoming, just curious, are you planning your network or staffing any differently into peak holiday season? How do you think about the operational risks around that?\nRobert Isom: Hey, Andrew, it's Robert. We're getting ready for the holiday season. We expect a lot of passengers. Tremendous pent up demand, especially as vaccinations take hold and infection rates decline and we're going to be ready. We have to get ready for the holidays always. This year, we're doing our best to make sure that we have right people in the right places at the right time. That's the effort and we're taking the appropriate precautions where necessary, but we're flying a full schedule as we go into the holidays and looking forward to it.\nVasu Rajar: Hey, Andrew. This is Vasu. One important thing to note is to clarify on your question also, the absolute ASM production of American Airlines in any month in the queue in the fourth quarter is actually less than the absolute ASMs that we're producing in July. Right, so we're very much -- from where we have been being able to go and get the big pools of demand as that have been out there at geographies that are really favorable to us has really worked out but as things shaped up. We are very much managing the [Indiscernible] profitability of the airline. Just to clarify so that gets lost in the year-over-year versus 2019 comparisons.\nAndrew Didora: That's a fair point. Thank you. Then just second, maybe to ask the fuel question a little bit differently. I think I know the answer to this, but over the past year, year plus, did you ever consider introducing a hedging policy and do you think that this is an option you could rethink going forward? Thanks.\nDoug Parker: Yeah. Andrew, [Indiscernible] we've been quite happy being unhedged now for however many years.\nDerek Kerr: [Indiscernible]\nDoug Parker: I'm sorry, what?\nDerek Kerr: 2008.\nDoug Parker: 2008 We stopped hedging and that feels right to us. What we find is -- what I said is over time the industry adjusts, and what generally happens is we end up paying a premium for the hedge without much benefit at all. So, I don't want to say we won't ever do it, but it's not something we began to look at [Indiscernible] We prefer actually, we think we have a regional economic hedge in terms of what happens with fuel prices and the economy as well. So obviously, we've come together and have us tell you not right now.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMike Linenberg: Good morning, everyone. Derek, you talked about the delayed 787 is providing or creating a bit of a CASM headwind in the fourth quarter. Can you just remind us how many airplanes -- how many incremental 787s were you supposed to have in 4Q and how many percentage points of headwind is that just roughly?\nDerek Kerr: Well, it depends on when we were taking. But earlier, we were supposed to have all 13 in 2021. That schedule has changed weekly. If you go back to last quarter, we probably had 6 of them built into the schedule. It probably a point of ASMs that we had to take out of the schedule. That's really what's driving a lot of this. Then as I said, the regional, we went ahead and pull-down in ASMs from a regional perspective, just a pilot supportability, which we will -- which we're getting all under control right now. But both of those have caused a reduction in ASMs that we would have flown in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the 788s.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Then just my second question, and this is either Doug or Robert. Can you be willing to share with us where you stand on vaccinations across your employee work group? Then just any thoughts on the testing, which it seems like every carrier is going to have exemption issues and they're going to have to test and we're hearing that costs are high, they're not, you don't have guidance from the government. Is it a meaningful cost headwind that we have to worry about or? Anything that you can share on that topic would be great. Thanks.\nRobert Isom: Hey, I'll start. It's Robert. Look, the vast majority of our team members are vaccinated, and we're working through the process. We set a November 24th deadline for vaccination or accommodation request to be provided. We don't expect anybody to leave American Airlines. Certainly, they're going to be out there helping us during the holiday. So no issues there. We don't know what exactly in -- a combination would look like for the minimal number of people that actually apply for that. But it's likely to be some combination of masking self-declaration and testing. And that testing, we don't, we don't know the details of. We're working through that. As time goes on, we'll be able to fill you in.\nDoug Parker: Yes. Thanks, Robert and Mike. I certainly wouldn't be [Indiscernible] costs in your forecast. So to the extent there will be testing going on, it will be for those who have chose they still have to be vaccinated [Indiscernible] religious or medical exemption that we are accommodating while there's still work. I don't suspect that'll be an extremely high percentage of the employees. I don't have [Indiscernible] that that's a material costs to test those individuals, [Indiscernible] standards once a week.  I don't know where on that, we're working through the accommodation process with our unions, but yeah, [Indiscernible] issue I would do everything I could to try and let you don't have to worry about that piece. As to the -- again, just to follow-up, just to reinforce what Robert said. I think it was part a little bit of Andrew's questions. Certainly when this was first announced, I think there were concerns about what was going to mean for airlines to TSA and others.  [Indiscernible] extremely comfortable with that. That was accurate to see yesterday the comments from the White House from [Indiscernible] and about how the goal of this is to get everybody vaccinated not to punish anyone and they're going to have people [Indiscernible] really just for medical exemptions, they'll be accommodated [Indiscernible] hear from all the airlines, we're all well-prepared to meet all federal mandates and meet all the customers that are coming to [Indiscernible] .\nMike Linenberg: Very good. Thanks, guys.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Your line is now open.\nDoug Parker: Hi, Ali.\nAlison Sider : Hi. I have a vaccine question. Just curious -- I know you talked a lot about the exceptions, but what sort of planning or strategizing you guys might be doing if it does end up being some portion of the workforce that just doesn't get vaccinated or has to be terminated or something like that. Is there a kind of a plan B or a backup plan for how you'd handle that?\nDoug Parker: Well, again, first off, we'll with what we know, we know which is again the vast majority of our employees are vaccinated, and we're seeing that rise every day as the mandates were put in place. So we're highly confident by the time we get to November [Indiscernible] when the demand comes in place that we're going to be down to a very small number of people if any that are either not vaccinated or don't have a valid medical or religious exemption. So I understand your -- I understand your question is whether or not that's true. But I -- first off, I don't think that's going to be the case and we know that based on the [Indiscernible] .  But however -- again -- so that's why I think the answer is -- but even in the case that that happens, we'll continue to work with those employees that have, that have chosen to get to that point. Again, I think it's going to be a really small number. But whatever that number is, we'll continue to work to accommodate those employees and make sure that they continue -- they -- that are -- that we're working together. Again, as Jeff Sine suggested they'd be doing with government employees, we'll be doing the same with ours. We have flexibility, but I don't think we're going to need that.\nRobert Isom: Okay. I'll just add. We're working with the team and we're working with our labor unions as well to get everybody vaccinated right now. So you see that we continue to provide incentives for team members to get vaccinated turn in records of their cards. We're working with the entire team to collect that information, as we speak. Fortunately, every day, we see good signs that word is getting out and people are turning in vaccination status or accommodation request. As Doug said, we're really confident that we'll be in great shape as we come into the holidays.\nAlison Sider : Got it. I mean, your pilots have been saying that that will serve the whole debate and controversy is becoming a distraction and leading to some potential safety issues. Are you seeing that in your data at all?\nRobert Isom: Look, we have an obligation to make sure that we're focused on flying. So any type of distraction, whether its vaccine or anything else, we want to jump on. To that end, we're -- again, we're working closely with our labor units to make sure that we're on top of anything that is potentially a safety concern. But we're [Indiscernible] schedule of flying very well and flying it incredibly safely. We set very, very high standards, not just for the industry, but especially for American Airlines.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Your line is now open.\nLeslie Josephs : Hi everyone. I'm just trying to square this idea that you don't expect any employees to leave American Airlines, but this week you told them again that they could be terminated if they don't comply with the mandate, either getting vaccinated or the exemptions? Then, how come the exemption -- the mandate doesn't apply to your wholly-owned subsidiaries [Indiscernible] government contracts?\nRobert Isom: Thank you, Leslie. I just start, first off, we have an executive order and so there's not a lot of debate or argument. We're trying to find best ways to comply. So all our efforts are making sure that our team members get vaccinated. To that end, as we've said, we're seeing the kind of results that we want. We have no desires to see anybody leave American and through getting vaccinated, which we're making very available and easy for folks to get done. Or those -- the small numbers that apply for accommodations, we will continue to work with people to encourage them to make sure that they take care of themselves.  We're working cooperatively with our labor unions as well, and we have different agreements that we have to follow in accordance with our collective [Indiscernible] agreements to make sure that we're doing everything possible to make sure that people stay with American and we're looking through that and we're committed to take care of our team.\nDoug Parker: Again, just a distinction. I think Leslie, between where early on in this process there was concern about not having enough people and where you're seeing everyone get now is, there was -- I think there was a period that that was at least somehow [Indiscernible] those who could not get vaccinated or chose to not get vaccinated, would be on unpaid leave or something like that [Indiscernible] that's what give us the comfort, we do know there will be some people on American Airlines who have a reason they can't get vaccinated, they will have exemptions. But if we have exemptions, we're going to work to accommodate them.  They also can do their jobs and that's that I think if anything between a few weeks ago to now where you're hearing extreme comfort around our ability to deliver versus where we might have been when we first heard this. That's the distinction, and the exact same distinction. By the way as I said, that we heard yesterday from the administration about TSA and other agencies. That's what gives us a comfort. That's why we think we're not going to see anyone leaving American -- it's not like anyone's going to want to leave American because they can't get -- because either they just -- they choose not to get vaccinated or they don't have a religious or medical exemption. On the -- on our subsidiaries, just like every other airline, the regional carriers are not subject to the mandate.  They'll -- they have to work through that themselves to see whether or not they deem themselves federal contractors. But to the extent they're not, they're not subject to the mandate. They will be subject to the OSHA requirement when it's effective for airline -- for companies that have 100 or more employees. At that point, they will need to respond accordingly. But there isn't. I certainly don't think, between American, Delta, United, none of the regional carriers than any of us use are working toward a vaccine mandate this way because they have concluded they don't have -- they're not covered by the mandate.\nLeslie Josephs : Okay. Then for the exemption, do you expect to approve all of them?\nDoug Parker: No, of course not, don't worry, no. Again, what I believe is -- what I really believe [Indiscernible] is going to be a small percent of the workforce. At most everyone will get vaccinated. But certainly there are always medical exemptions and to the extent people have valid medical exceptions, we're not going to put them on an unpaid leave and we going to make accommodations for them as we should sort of [Indiscernible] and for those that don't receive approval for those exemptions, we fully expect them to get vaccinated.\nLeslie Josephs : Got it. Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Leslie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Koenig with Associated Press. Your line is now open.\nDoug Parker: Hey, David.\nDavid Koenig: Hi. Good morning. Good morning, Doug. I have two follow-up questions, but I'll try and be quick. First, sticking with the vaccination theme, United and Delta have put numbers out there, and why can't you tell us how many or what percentage of your employees are vaccinated? Secondly, and this goes back to something that came up a couple of times on the analyst section about flying a fourth quarter schedule that's pretty close to 2019 levels and how you're going to do that with your current headcount. Why shouldn't passengers expect to see the same kind of disruptions that you had over the summer?\nRobert Isom: Look, David, I'll take that. Look, we have done a tremendous job of making sure that we're set to fire our schedules. As we said in our comments, we flew most reliable September in our Company's history and that's the kind of performance that you can expect from American going forward. We did a tremendous ramp up to get to where we were during the summer. By the way as Vasu mentioned in some of his comments, the schedule we're going to fly around the holidays is actually larger than what we had flown during the summer. All we've done since that time, has been able to add more resource to make sure our partners are better positioned and that we're better equipped to handle whatever may come our way. So we feel really confident on that point. In regard to --\nDerek Kerr: And I would add to that Robert.\nRobert Isom: Okay.\nDerek Kerr: David, hi. This is Derek, the hiring we're doing now is for the summer of next year. So we're very confident having enough resources to run Thanksgiving and Christmas. We already have those people onboard.\nDoug Parker: He's asking in the next year, though.\nDerek Kerr: Yeah.\nDoug Parker: [Indiscernible] the structure we had at the end of June was purely us just not having as many parts for the train processes as we'd expected. We've rectified that issue, and we're going to make sure that we have -- as we expand, that we have the right number employees. That's not an issue at all. To answer your first question, yeah, I guess [Indiscernible] have released their numbers. Our number is still moving every day as more and more people are getting vaccinated. [Indiscernible] one of them put in place on a unilateral mandate for their teams so that -- if they're through with that.  The other one put in place requirement. But if you are not vaccinated, you're going to pay more for your medical benefits. It's already in place. But I don't think any other airlines have talked about exactly where they are and probably for the same reasons, we haven't because we had a voluntary program in place, and now we have a mandate in place, and that number continues to grow. What we know is, by the time we get to November 24th, we're going to be where the others are, which is virtually everyone vaccinated. Those that aren't, will have valid medical or religious exemption because we'll be flying our airline, taking care of our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dawn Gilbertson with USA TODAY. Your line is now open.\nDawn Gilbertson : Hi. Good morning. Of course another vaccine mandate, holiday travel question. Specifically, Scott Kirby, which you no doubt aware of, yesterday had some pretty strong comments predicting a holiday travel meltdown for everyone, of course, but United. But I wondered, he's saying, even if, say you do have to go to testing for some of these people that he said, if there's a weather melt, if you think of weather meltdown is something where do you see as these people tests positive last minute and a slurry of last-minute flight cancellations, so ensure he is predicting, [Indiscernible] beware for people. How do you specifically respond to that? My second question is, who is approving these exemptions? Is that just the Company or is -- does the government play a role in that too? Thank you very much for any color.\nDoug Parker: Yes, Dawn. Again I [Indiscernible] discuss comments, but anyway, [Indiscernible] if that's what he says. It's not right, of course [Indiscernible] you know, we'll be well prepared for all the reason you [Indiscernible] . I'm highly confident that we are going to [Indiscernible] schedule and whatever the accommodation process is I expect, again, for a large percentage of the airline and certainly won't be process that will be cumbersome on the operation. So, we're still working with the accommodation process will be with our unions and there'll be some combinations of testing, and masks, and social distancing and things like that as it should be, had to make sure everyone is safe.  But we do need to accommodate those who have valid medical order [Indiscernible] to exemptions. Again, I go back to at least the OSHA requirement is weekly testing. So I'm not saying it's where we'll end up, but I don't -- it's not going to certainly [Indiscernible] operational impact we anticipate having all the people [Indiscernible] when it first came out because we didn't have this kind of direction. We are not remotely concerned now. As to who approves the exemptions, I think that's the employer's duty to improve the exemptions.\nRobert Isom: In fact, we already have a process in place and have to deal with accommodation requests already.\nDoug Parker: [Indiscernible] because of visibility. I'm sorry. Robert, go ahead.\nRobert Isom: Yeah, that's it.\nDoug Parker: It's the same process, it's just bigger now.\nDawn Gilbertson: Thank you very much.\nDoug Parker: Please go on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bachman with Bloomberg. Your line is now open.\nJustin Bachman: Thanks for the time today. I wanted to ask about the DOJ lawsuit regarding your relationship with JetBlue in the Northeast. Are there any discussions going on with the government about that lawsuit in terms of any type of concessions or changes to that agreement or is this a case where it's kind of all or nothing in your view?\nDoug Parker: That's what we [Indiscernible], we're going to on [Indiscernible] This is highly beneficial to consumers, and we're perplexed as to why they file this lawsuit and [Indiscernible]\nJustin Bachman: Doug, did you say the discussions were ongoing at the time and they still are they're not going up?\nDoug Parker: [Indiscernible] they're not going up. [Indiscernible] are talking to lawyers. I don't know anything like that. But I can tell you for certain, the Company is not interested in sort of talks about settling this. We feel extremely good about our case. It gets better every day as we continue to expand and provide more service to customers.\nJustin Bachman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News. Your line is now open.\nKyle Arnold: Hey. How are you adjusting your staffing levels at the same levels that you had done in previous years when you look forward to the holiday season? I know some other airlines have said that they essentially have to put more workers on the line and have more workers out there as they come out of this pandemic. How are you approaching staffing over the next couple of months?\nRobert Isom: I'll take that. We're going in for holidays just as we always do. We've done a remarkable job. I want to give a shout out to our team. You know, American Airlines in terms of real reliability, arriving on time and in completion factor, we're not at the top of the industry, but I'll tell you what we're beating our other network competitors. They're doing a real nice job of managing through the pandemic. So really pleased with that and that kind of attitude goes into how we look forward to the holidays. We'll be ready for and make sure that we have staff in place and make sure that customers have a very nice experience.\nKyle Arnold: But you're not adding extra staff or adjusting staffing levels upward?\nRobert Isom: Just specific [Indiscernible] issue, you have to get ready for things like [Indiscernible], weight-finding in the airports, managing security, TSA security lines, load factors will be hire. So we always have a provision to make sure that we have staffing at the gates to accommodate. As Derek mentioned as well, we're doing hiring throughout the business, and that includes places like our reservations offices as well. All that is being bolstered from where we are today. Again, those kind of things that we would've done in the past we'll be ready for, and looking forward to the holidays.\nKyle Arnold: Thanks, Robert.\nOperator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Doug Parker for closing remarks.\nDoug Parker: Thank you very much. We appreciate your interest. Any other question, please let Investor Relations or [Indiscernible] communications know. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "AAL", "quarter": 2, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-07-22 13:57:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the American Airlines Group Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants\u2019 lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.\nDan Cravens: Thanks, Jerome, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On the call this morning, we have Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call for Q&A session are several of our senior executives, including Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Vasu Raja, Chief Revenue Officer; Elise Eberwein, Chief People & Communications Officer; Alison Taylor, Chief Customer Officer; and Devon May, our Senior VP of Finance. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and update to the actions we\u2019ve taken during the pandemic and through the recovery. Robert will then follow with some remarks about our operations, commercial and other strategic initiatives. After Robert\u2019s remarks, Derek will follow with details on the quarter and our operating plans going forward. After Derek\u2019s comments, we\u2019ll open the call for analyst questions, and lastly, questions from the media. As a reminder, to get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast, capacity, fleet plans and liquidity. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. In addition, we\u2019ll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financials is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on the website, and the information that we\u2019re giving you on the call is as of today\u2019s date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thanks again for joining us. At this point, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. This morning, American reported a second quarter net profit of $19 million. Excluding net special items, it was a net loss of $1.1 billion. This loss, while large, is the smallest we've had since the start of the pandemic as demand for air travel has improved significantly throughout the quarter. Our revenues in the quarter were 87% higher than they were just last quarter. At the beginning of this year, we outlined our Green Flag plan, a set of initiatives that we have focused on to reset the airline and make American stronger as we come out of the crisis. As a reminder, this work focused on four key objectives: doubling down on operational excellence, reconnecting with our customers, building on the positive momentum with established spreadsheet and passionately driving vision. And keeping our focus on these areas, we knew that while the pandemic starts to recede and the green flag drop, that American will be ready. Robert and Derek are going to share a lot more details, but the short story is the green flag has dropped. We are indeed ready, and the American Airlines' team is delivering results and a return. We've flown more customers than any other airline in the second quarter. Our team safely transported more than 44 million passengers on nearly 470,000 flights. It's more than five times the number of passengers we carried in the second quarter of 2020 and more than two-and-a-half times the number of flights. We've ramped up the operation dramatically in response to customer demand, and our operational performance continues to improve as we grow in scale. Our team has done a phenomenal job of taking care of our customers. Our on-time performance and our completion factor for the quarter was the best in our history, despite the significant ramp-up in operations. The increases in demand in flying have led to a considerable increase in our revenues. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that American has outperformed our large competitors on passenger unit revenue production. Importantly, while we're producing industry-leading unit revenues, we're also controlling our costs. All of this has led to a dramatic narrowing of our losses, as I noted at the beginning. Notably, we were profitable, excluding net special lines for the month of June, the first of such month since December of 2019. We expect our losses to narrow even more in the third quarter as we continue to march back to sustained profitability. As to our balance sheet, we entered second quarter with more than $21 billion of total available liquidity, by far the highest in American's history. We generated a cash build in the quarter for the first time since the pandemic. With this record liquidity and our confidence in the future, we've begun the deleveraging of American's balance sheet. This morning, we prepaid the entirety of our $950 million term spare parts term loan, which was scheduled to mature until April 2023. Derek will talk more about our deleveraging plans during his remarks, but I'll just say it feels great now being in a position of prepaying debt well before the term is due rather than continuing to incur it. In summary, I couldn't be prouder of this team. In response to demand, we're building back on our network faster than our largest competitors. We're hearing far more customers than any other airline, and our team is doing so safely with great care for our customers. We've reshaped our networks, simplified our fleet, and build efficiencies into the business that will serve us well for years to come. And today, as the recovery continues, we've begun the deleveraging of our balance sheet. So, thanks for the hard work and dedication of the American team. And because of that, we are in the midst of an unprecedented recovery, and it shows in our results. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to acknowledge the tremendous efforts and resilience with the American Airlines team, but we're still in the early stages of the rebound, we feel really good about the result \u2013 the progress that we've made to build back our business differently and the results it's producing. This progress was only possible because of the outstanding work of our team. This quarter, we rebuilt the operations up from pandemic-level flying, effectively adding an airline the size of the old U.S. Airways over the course of just a few months. We were able to fortify our staffing by completing all the required recall pilot training, bringing back more than 3,000 team members from leaves with thousands more flight attendants returning from leaves this fall and hiring nearly 3,500 new team members throughout the operation. We also plan to hire 350 pilots this year and more than 1,000 pilots and 800 flight attendants next year. As Doug noted, in the second quarter, we operated more than two-and-a-half times the number of flights we operated over the same period last year. We had a second quarter completion factor of 98.6% and an on-time arrival rate of 82.1%. That represents our best-ever performance for those two metrics in the second quarter, and the momentum has continued into July. Demand for our product remains strong and we're very encouraged by the trends we're seeing in the revenue environment. The recovery is happening. Our second quarter passenger revenue more than doubled sequentially to $6.5 billion as demand surged. On a unit revenue basis, our second quarter PRASM was up 42% sequentially from the first quarter and a 44% sequential increase in capacity. Despite the industry-wide increase in service, this marks the fourth quarter in a row that we've outperformed our peers on a passenger revenue unit basis. Our net bookings have recovered and are fully recovered, and we're focused on yield managing demand while bringing back the network in full. We've seen no degradation in bookings related to the recent uptick in COVID infection rates. Leisure demand continues to outperform, and in many areas, it has surpassed 2019 levels. Even more encouraging, as vaccinations have increased, business travel has started to return in a meaningful way. Domestic business revenue has \u2013 was approximately 20% of 2019 levels in March, but it more than doubled to approximately 45% in June with revenue from small and medium-sized businesses recovering at a faster pace than large corporate accounts. Looking forward, we expect business recovery to continue and accelerate. In the coming months, our share of bookings in key business channels remains ahead of 2019. And customers are telling us that they're eager to travel and some of our largest corporate accounts have already lifted all travel restrictions and many have already returned to the office. Critically, the majority have shared their expectation for travel to pick up moving into the fall. We now expect a full business travel recovery in 2022. All of this is great news. And the American team is ready and excited to welcome back our corporate customers. We still expect the international travel, particularly long-haul international travel to be slower to fully return. The reality is many countries have not rolled out vaccines as quickly in the U.S., so travel restrictions and quarantine requirements are still in place in many locations. Whenever restrictions are lifted, we see a quick and dramatic increase in bookings, demonstrating that there is significant pent-up demand for international travel. For example, demand for travel to Europe has increased considerably in recent weeks with the reopening of EU. And our book load factor across the Atlantic is approximately 35 points ahead of the same time last quarter and it continues to strengthen. We're committed to building the best and most convenient global network for our customers as they return to this path. This includes making improvements in our key hubs, bolstering our partnerships, growing the AAdvantage program, harmonizing our fleet for consistent customer experience and reopening our clubs and lounges. We continue to invest in our hubs to improve the experience for our customers. At DFW, we recently opened four new gates, which will allow us to continue to grow organically in our largest and most profitable hub. And we expect to file a larger domestic network at DFW this August than we did in August of 2019. In Charlotte, we opened four new gates just prior to the pandemic, but we expect to open three additional gates before the end of this year. These gates will allow us to grow efficiently in our East Coast connecting hub as customers return to travel. And at DCA, we have officially opened a new regional concourse, which offers a significantly improved experience for our customers, including an all dual-class regional operations. Importantly, it also allows us to up-gauge the hub to larger aircraft overall. We continue to develop partnerships that bolster our network and improve the customer journey. There's no better example of this than our partnerships with Alaska on the West Coast and JetBlue in the Northeast. Those partnerships are already delivering benefits, giving customers more choice and driving revenue in 2 very competitive markets. American is happy we now offer a leading network in New York and Boston, making it easier for customers, particularly corporate customers to return to travel. Our Northeast alliance has enabled us to start new service between New York and Tel Aviv, Athens, Santiago and Colombia, and we now have daily service slated to start this winter. Our domestic partnerships complement an already broad set of relationships American has around the globe. We have new exciting developments on the horizon, and all these international partnerships will really start to take off as more travel restrictions are lifted. We continue to focus on growing the AAdvantage program. Our total number of transacting members is the highest since the start of the pandemic and up 50% year-over-year. We've also seen a strong co-brand acquisition growth, which has more than doubled since the first quarter and has climbed back to over 80% of 2019 levels. We're focused on expanding the program itself, growing the membership base and making advantage of the centerpiece of our partnership going forward. Our fleet harmonization program continues, which not only delivers a consistent customer experience, but improves reliability throughout the operation and gives us a more efficient fleet. It also enhances the revenue generating capabilities of the aircraft, while giving us a unique cost tailwind. Our 737s are now complete, and we've completed the interior work on dozens of A321s in the second quarter. We now have just over 100 aircraft left before A321 have a standard onboard product by early next year. Now that our 737 fleet is fully harmonized, our customers will have industry-leading Wi-Fi, power in every seat and larger overhead bids. In total, we're now flying more than 350 narrow-body aircraft with new consistent interiors. Most importantly, the customers' feedback on these aircraft has been exceptional. Additionally, one of the things we know is that lounge space greatly enhances the customer journey. We've reopened 37 Admirals Club lounges in 25 locations, and all of them will reopen by the end of August. Our Flagship Lounge locations will start reopening this fall as premium and corporate traffic returns in the second half of 2021. Lastly, we continue to make investments to ensure that we're running a more sustainable airline. In the second quarter, we announced an investment in Vertical Aerospace to develop electric and vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, doubling down on our focus on emerging technologies to reduce carbon emissions and infecting in innovative ways that could improve the customer journey. The last week, we've committed to develop a science based target for reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, supporting American's existing commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. We also agreed to terms to purchase up to 10 million gallons of carbon neutral, sustainable aviation fuel. We're committed to reducing our carbon footprint and mitigating our most significant climate related risks, so investors should expect to see more developments like these in the future. In closing, as more customers return to flying, we're taking action to strengthen and re-imagine our business. This work, coupled with the continued efforts of the American Airlines team will have us well-positioned for the post-pandemic world. Now I'll turn it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I want to echo Doug and Robert's comments and thank our team members for their hard work over the past quarter. We've significantly grown our airline since the first quarter, and the process of bringing the world's largest airline back online was not an easy task, but our team made it happen. This morning, we reported a second quarter GAAP net profit of $19 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Excluding net special credits, we reported a net loss of $1.1 billion or $1.69 loss per share. With the rapid return of demand that Robert discussed, our financial performance has continued to improve. This trend started in March when we began to see a significant acceleration in demand that continued throughout the second quarter and drove net bookings to 2019 levels. This improvement in demand led to an 87% sequential increase in total revenue versus the first quarter. Even more encouraging is that we were able to capture this additional revenue while remaining focused on our cost and efficiency initiatives. As we have articulated in the past, our goal throughout the pandemic was to prudently keep our capacity aligned with demand while being flexible enough to adapt as needed. We've done just that and moved swiftly to lower our cost structure and drive efficiencies throughout the organization with more than $1.3 billion of permanent cost reductions. This includes $500 million in management headcount reductions, $600 million in labor productivity initiatives, and $200 million in other efficiencies. Based on our results, it's clear these actions are beginning to pay off as our second quarter CASM, excluding fuel, net special items of $0.1261, was up just 11% versus the same period in 2019 despite flying 25% less capacity. Looking at this from another angle, despite a 44% sequential increase in total capacity, our second quarter total operating expense, excluding fuel and net special items, increased by only 11% versus the first quarter of 2021. In addition to our improved financial results, we also saw improvements in our cash position and liquidity. For the first time since the pandemic began, we produced quarterly positive cash build in the second quarter of $1 million per day. While $1 million per day doesn't sound as much, we've come a long way from our peak cash burn of approximately $100 million per day early in the pandemic. As a reminder, our definition of cash build includes approximately $12 million per day of regular debt principal and cash severance payments. As a result, we ended the quarter with approximately $21.3 billion of total available liquidity, which was higher than our original forecast due to the increase in revenues and forward bookings during the quarter. As we look ahead, we feel confident that our record level of available liquidity is more than enough to allow American to navigate the recovery. In the near-term, we plan to keep liquidity at elevated levels, but expect to step down our target liquidity to approximately $10 billion to $12 billion at some point in 2022. We will continually assess this liquidity target as we make further progress in the recovery, the company returns to sustained profitability, we reduce our net debt levels and we increase our unencumbered asset base. As we have said previously, all liquidity in excess of these targets will be applied to accelerating our deleveraging plans for the foreseeable future. As we discussed on our last call, American will pay down $8 billion to $10 billion of debt by the end of 2025 through amortization of our existing debt in excess of any additional debt we expect to incur. However, because of that debt -- because of the debt we needed to take on during the pandemic, our plan is to accelerate the reduction of debt beyond that natural deleveraging that will occur. We now forecast reducing our debt levels by more than $15 billion by the end of 2025 by using excess cash and free cash flow to pay down pre-payable debt, even though most of it is efficiently priced and by not adding to our debt levels by potentially using cash instead of debt for some future aircraft deliveries. This reduction in debt level will be facilitated by the relatively low capital expenditure profile we have had over the -- we will have over the next several years because our fleet modernization program is now behind us. In addition to deleveraging our balance sheet, this will allow us to smooth our near-term maturity towers and free up high-quality collateral. With this level of debt reduction and continued margin improvement, our plan is to achieve the best credit metrics in the history of post-merger American by the end of that 4-year period, if not sooner. As evidence of our commitment to delever and our confidence in the future, this morning, we prepaid the entirety of our $950 million spare parts term loan that was scheduled to mature in April 2023. This note had a coupon rate of only LIBOR plus 200, but prepaying it sets the stage for future optimization of our unencumbered collateral pool. The prepayment also results in an improvement of our first lien capacity from $7.5 billion to $8.4 billion. The $950 million prepaid today is in addition to $985 million of debt amortization and prepayments that we made during the second quarter. During the third quarter, we will also free up 20 Boeing 777 aircraft that will be released out of the 2013-2 and 2013-1WTC transactions, further improving our unencumbered asset base. The deleveraging of American's balance sheet has begun, and we are committed to significant steady and continuous debt reduction over the years ahead. Looking to the third quarter, we expect our capacity to be down approximately 15% to 20% versus the third quarter of 2019. Based on current demand assumptions and capacity plans, we expect another significant sequential increase in our revenue and expect total revenue to be down approximately 20% versus the third quarter of 2019. In total, we expect a pretax margin, excluding net special items, of between negative 3% and 7%. For the full year, we project debt principal payments are expected to be $2.8 billion, excluding the repayment of our revolving credit facilities that we completed earlier this year. With respect to capital expenditures, we continue to expect full year 2021 CapEx to remain minimal. Non-aircraft CapEx remains at approximately $900 million and net aircraft CapEx, including PDPs, remains an inflow of $1 billion. Lastly, at this stage of the recovery, we no longer feel that daily cash metrics are constructive in understanding the underlying performance of the business. As such, we will return to guiding to our standard operating and financial metrics as outlined in our investor update that we issued this morning. So in conclusion, we continue to feel good about the improving demand and revenue environment. Our team has done an amazing job of managing our liquidity and driving efficiencies throughout the organization, and we are very well positioned for the future. With that, we'll open the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time.\nDoug Parker: Hey, Catherine.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey. So first question on the deleveraging plan. For your plan to prepay, I guess, it's $5 billion to $7 billion through 2025 on top of that $8 billion to $10 billion in scheduled amortization. Can you just help us think \u2013 can you tell us about the pacing of that prepayment? Of course, assuming it will be tied to free cash flow ramp other \u2013 for profitability metrics. Do you see the gating factor or other capital allocation requirements we should be thinking about that might influence that pace? And then I guess maybe like a quick secondary question on the back of that also, could it actually be more front-end loaded as you step down your minimum liquidity next year? Thanks.\nDoug Parker: Yeah. Thanks, Catherine. Yeah, it's all going to depend on that as you just said at the end. It's - as we step down our cash requirements, we will use the cash to pay off the debt. So the way we're looking at it is if we can \u2013 we're at 2021 now, we just paid down $1 billion in 2020. We'll take that down to $10 billion to $12 billion sometime in 2022. So when we do step it down, we will use all of that excess cash to pay off of the debt. We have a significant amount of debt that is pre-payable. A lot of that is efficient debt, but we still believe it's the right move to do. So I do think it will be front loaded. As we look at the amortization today, it's pretty even throughout the four years as we look at it. There is more out in probably 2023, 2024 because the AAdvantage loan does start to amortize out in those years. So that adds to the amortization. But I do believe, as we step down from where we're at today to the $10 billion to $12 billion, and then if we do step down again over time, that all of that cash will go to debt. So I would believe that it would be more front-end loaded as we think about it.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. That's great. Thanks. And then a question just maybe on the codeshare agreements. As codeshare demand is starting -- excuse me, corporate demand is starting to rebound here, obviously, still in early innings. But can you just talk about how adding a new JetBlue codeshare or to enhance the last codeshare has influenced your discussions going forward, either with corporate accounts where you might have overlap, or in regions where your partners have had a stronger presence than you have had historically? Thanks.\nVasu Raja: Yeah. Hey, Catie, this is Vasu. I can handle that. We are really encouraged, both with the progress and the results that we've seen from both of our domestic partnerships, even though it's really only been -- the better part is six to eight weeks where elapse has been up and running and really three or four weeks, where the JetBlue codeshare has been up and running. But very much the design of this partnership is to go shore up on two parts where -- of the domestic system where our network was structurally weaker. One is the West Coast and the other is the Northeast, both of which are the largest originating market for business travel, for corporate travel, for small mid-market travel, however, it might otherwise be. And so we've had a really encouraging response from corporate customers. We continue to have one. There\u2019s a lot of integration work that must be done still, and that's a major focus of us. But we're encouraged by what we see in both cases. First, in the case of Alaska. Again, while the results are early, the key indicators, when we put it together, was to ensure, one, more long-haul -- a successful long-haul franchise off the West Coast; two, a better network for the West Coast originating customer, again, that's a business customer; but three, more utility for all of our customers who are in the Midwest and the Southeast and are looking to go West. And though we haven't seen long-haul emerge just because of the trends that are there, from what we see right now, about 20% or so of the bookings in the public data is all from the Intrawest customer, which is exactly the kind of business customer that we weren't getting before. We're also encouraged that 80% of the bookings way, way overperformed our expectations are from customers looking to go West. And we've been able to go and put more demand through these codes, while fulfilling the organic network through DFW in Chicago. So we\u2019re encouraged by that and we continue to be as we go and scale up in Northeast partnership with JetBlue us well.\nDoug Parker: Hey, Alison, why don\u2019t you give a flavor for what you\u2019re hearing directly from the corporate as you've been out on the road?\nAlison Taylor: Yes, just to add on what Vasu said Robert, having just talked with most of our large corporate account. I just see it is simplicity of our network arrangement and contracting with us, as we do that together with our new alliances is something that really assists the truck manager and the travelers. We have been able to sign our largest, most complex global accounts to both Alaska and JetBlue. It just makes it easier and more seamless for them to have a great network and have great offerings through our joint loyalty partnerships as well and through having a one-stop shop for the sales side of us as well.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the questions. I guess, Derek, on the deleveraging plan, can you maybe just help us a little bit with maybe the free cash flow build beyond this year? Can you give us a general idea of kind of what level, I guess, net CapEx can be beyond 2021? And can you remind us what your pension contribution requirement is this year and next?\nDerek Kerr: Yes. Well, firstly, with the pension is going to -- I mean, with the paydown, it\u2019s going to be using the excess cash that we have as we go forward. So just, we'll have a significant amount of that used to prepay the debt. But as we move forward, next year in 2022, we only have about $2.6 million of CapEx, about $1 billion -- we're forecasting about $1 billion in non-aircraft CapEx for the next four years, so we've kind of left it back. It might have come in a little bit below, a little bit above that. From a gross aircraft CapEx, we have about $1.5 billion in 2022 and $1.8 billion in 2023. And then the other thing to look at is debt payments in 2022, we only really have one significant debt payment, which is the unsecured. So, we only have about $2.5 billion of debt payments in 2022, steps up to about $4.4 billion in 2023. So, each of those two years are going to be significant as -- if the earnings are where we believe they are, we'll have more free cash flow to pay that off. From a pension perspective, we really don't have any pension contributions in 2022 or 2023 necessary. So, there's a small one, we think, in 2023 of about $50 million, but zero in 2022. So, not a lot of cash requirements for either capital, debt paydown, or pension contributions over the next couple of years, which will enable us to have significant free cash flow to start to delever along with the excess liquidity that we believe we will have over that time period.\nAndrew Didora: That's great color. Thank you for that. And then my second question, maybe Robert or Vasu, in your down-20% revenue outlook for 3Q, can you maybe provide us a little color on how you see the domestic yield environment progressing throughout the quarter? And if you can, can you give us what percentage of your expected 3Q revenues are already booked now? And how does that compare to pre-COVID levels? Thanks.\nVasu Raja: Yes, this is Vasu. I can help with both. Look, as we look into 3Q really, we continue to see a lot of the same trends that we're seeing in June and July and the first half of August. As schools go back to return in the second half of August and following Labor Day, there's a natural lightning in the leisure demand that we're seeing. And so, as we look out there, we're actually really encouraged by the yield environment. We're seeing yields that are in that period, 95% to 105% of where they were in 2019. As far as how much their bookings, as we get out into September, we're still only about 35% to 40% booked out there. So, there's yet a little bit of room out there. And the way we consciously built the airlines as we go into that period. It is very much that it will be maybe a little bit less of the opportunistic leisure stuff that we've been doing a little bit more starting to orient that what we're seeing is the return of business travel. So, we're encouraged by the trends that we see out there, but we really are planning that a material amount of business travel won't come back until after the October period.\nOperator: And your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for the time. Vasu, maybe could you talk a little bit about how the dynamic on business fairs are -- is behaving kind of relative to a normal pre-COVID level? I'm just trying to get a sense for whether you're starting to see some close-in bookings or I know the activity levels have improved, but how is the fair dynamic working in there? And if you could also comment a little bit on kind of where you are in getting the traditional sort of revenue management algorithms to kick in?\nVasu Raja: Yes. That's an excellent question. And probably the second one helps give context for the first one, so I'll answer them in reverse order. When the pandemic began, we talked about this thing as a reset. We \u2013 for planning purposes, we take that very, very seriously that we describe the business on a year over 2 years basis. When it goes to planning the business, we work here and now. And one of the benefits of having more capacity out there is this enabled us to go and observe demand. So, we realized in the early days of this that the pandemic was going to be so big and so devastating that our historical demand forecast wouldn't work for probably a few years into the future. So, we've been pretty actively over the last year rebuilding our forecasting system. And clearly, through our Q3 results, there's some great effect and to the great work of our revenue management team. When we came in, in January and there is still a lot of uncertainty, one of the things that they noticed was that every single peak period we had more travel demand than what was there before. And it was actually, the booking curves are actually shifting further and further out with more people willing to pay also high fares closer in. So very actively set up the summer for that. And if you go and just look at the public data that's there, we very consciously built the airline and try to take as much demand as we could close to departure. And indeed, our market share inside of 14 days in the Q2 period was much greater than what it was outside of 14 days. So even though the fare environment was depressed, right, even though yields were at 80% to 85% of historical levels, we were taking a lot more share of inside 14 demand where we did indeed observe higher fares, more willingness to pay, more business style itineraries that were there. And that led to a lot of the results that you see where even though we have more capacity than others, we also have higher loads and high rate. And look, it's also enabled us to do -- we've got a much better handle on the nature of business travel. And we do see a lot of changes in trends and patterns that are there. And we believe that that\u2019s really well-positioned into the fall. But we haven't seen the booking curve shift outward. We do see people engaging in business style itineraries, single-day trips overnight with no bag, things like that, and we're encouraged by that return. So with that in mind, we remain encouraged for how much business travel can start to rebound. And certainly, when we -- when more corporations return to work, we think there will be a four to six-week lag and a pretty material pickup there as well.\nDavid Vernon: That's extraordinarily helpful. Thanks for that detail. I guess, maybe just as a quick follow-up. If you think about the partnerships with JetBlue and Alaska, obviously, that executive order came out. There was some commentary in there on the airlines and slots and things like that. Have you guys been directly approached by the DOJ to revisit any of that stuff, or are you worried about that happening? Can you comment on the partnership in the context of the recent executive order?\nDoug Parker: Steve Johnson will answer that.\nSteve Johnson: Hi. Thanks for the question. As we've said, we've been in discussions with the DOJ about the NEA really since we announced it. And I think the real answer to this question is Vasu\u2019s and Allison's comments earlier, but let me just summarize and refrain those. We designed the NEA for our customers. We designed it to be competitive. We designed it to allow us to do things to allow JetBlue and American to do things in the Northeast and in particular, in Boston and New York that we couldn't do on our own. And we designed it to allow us to grow and offer options to our customers that otherwise wouldn't be available. We're committed to that idea. I think what we've done with the NEA so far demonstrates that, that is going to be the case. I just -- we're really excited about the announcement that we made earlier this week about the NEA. And we're confident that at the end of the day, the regulators are going to see the value to customers and really the increase in competition that results from it. A couple of quarters ago, I was asked a similar question. And I said that we -- with the DOJ, in this case, doesn't have a deadline for taking action like they would in the case of a merger, and that we expected them to watch as the NEA was implemented and over time, make a decision about whether it was in the best interest of consumers. That seems to be what they're doing now, and we expect that to continue.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning everyone. Could you provide on the fleet harmonization side, with this kind of the success you're having with getting that done, just wondering if you could share with the cost and revenue benefit timing? And what that might look like relative to 2019?\nDerek Kerr: Yeah. Savi, this is Derek. I think the \u2013 I mean, the cost is all built into the capital plan. So what we've done with all of those projects within the $900 million non-aircraft CapEx because, as you can imagine, most of that stuff was purchased earlier, and now we're just putting it in the aircraft. All the 737s are done. And as Robert said, the A321s will be done by the end of the month. So the cost perspective is already in and it's already complete. What it will do is from an ASM perspective is it will increase ASMs. So, it should help the CASM as we go forward because we're adding those extra seats to the aircraft and that is all built into the CASM guidance that we have as we go forward from a revenue perspective.\nRobert Isom: Just again, remember that on the 737s, we effectively took the seat count from 160 to 172 seats. And on the A321s, which we still have, 100-plus left to reconfigure. We're taking the configuration up to 190 seats from either 187 seats or 183 seats. So, it's -- again, I'll reframe this in terms of those aircraft have all new seats, all new bins. They have new wide-wings [ph]. They have power. Of course, they already have the best in terms of satellite Wi-Fi. So, we have more seats to sell. It's a better product for our customers to win overall. It's something that we really haven't had the ability to go out and market over the last year. So this is something we're excited to do as we finish off 2021 and move into 2022.\nDerek Kerr: Yes. And Savi, from an operating perspective, for the airports to have the consistency of aircraft to swap and the move around has been very, very helpful from an operating perspective also.\nSavi Syth: Got it. So we should see some kind of margin benefit as we head into next year...\nDerek Kerr: Yes, into--\nSavi Syth: All of those combined. Thanks.\nDerek Kerr: Correct.\nSavi Syth: Great. And if I might quickly just follow-up on the business corporate demand recovery, appreciate kind of thinking of full recovery next year. Curious what you're thinking you might see kind of exiting this quarter and into the fourth quarter?\nVasu Raja: This is Vasu. Really, as we go through 3Q, we're not seeing a big alteration to the trends that we've seen sequentially so far. And if we're about -- if the corporate revenues are at 45% of where they were in 2019, from January to June, we've seen that build about seven to 10 points sequentially kind of month-to-month. And we don't really see anything between now and September, where seven to 10 points will either be materially higher or lower. In October, where we believe -- presently believe there's going to be a change that as we've seen companies return to work, especially across the Sun Belt, typically in a four to eight-week lag period after that, we start seeing them come back to travel. And with so many areas right at some of the lowest booking points of commencement are the New York corridor, D.C., and the Greater Chicago area with them, both returning back to school and back to work around Labor Day we anticipate that really it will be early to mid-October when that demand starts coming back. And Alison could add more, but that's so far is pretty consistent with what we're hearing from our corporates.\nAlison Taylor: Absolutely. 50% of our corporate customers have already listed their travel restrictions, and two-thirds have already planned to return to the offices by the end of 2021. So, this bodes well for a continuing uplift in corporate travel. And what we saw in Q1 and Q2, for our largest corporate accounts, we saw an 80% increase from Q1 to Q2. So, it's been a steady recovery. And it's been interesting for us to see some travel patterns that remain different than they were pre and some of that remain the same. For example, those that are different is that our travel remains less concentrated on peak days of the week, but the booking curve of corporate traffic continues to normalize towards 2019 levels.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey thanks. Your revenue outlook and margin outlook is better than what we were hoping for, which is consistent with peers that have reported thus far. I wanted to ask you about your ability to influence relative margins. you're guiding to kind of mid-single-digit negative pretax margins in the third quarter. Both of your network peers are guiding to positive, at least one is guiding to mid-single-digit positive. So just thinking back to 2019, you're starting from a lower margin baseline. So the same RASM and the same CASM trajectory is going to result in the same ranking on the other side of this pandemic. My question is, what is your plan to change the ranking? Do you expect American to be an industry plus RASM story or an industry minus CASM story? And I appreciate your thoughts.\nDoug Parker: So first off, I mean, as I know, looking at relative margins right now, it's hard to do. It's so volatile around how small the profits are and one airline is driving versus another and how fast revenues are going. For example, while you are right, I guess our 2 large competitors are forecasting to have the margins better than our forecast in next quarter. The actuals this quarter were 10 points better than United, for example. So \u2013 but one should not take that domain that we think we're going to have 10-point better margins. And going forward, my point is just that, that whether or not \u2013 some of it may be forecast plans. Who knows? So maybe forecast -- not so maybe more concerned and others don't know where is talking about we speak. But to your broader question as to going forward and what we think about relative margin performance, I firmly believe what you're going to see from us is when you look \u2013 when we all get to a real profitability and where you can actually compare these types of numbers, say, 2022, American's margin versus our 2 large competitors versus where it was in 2019 will be there, if not exceeding one of them. So that's what we certainly would expect. We expect that -- given what we're seeing today, we expect that given the $1.5 billion of cost efficiencies that we felt into the airline today. So anyway more to come on that, but I would really caution anybody from trying to look at margins today and comparing relative margins as to any sort of indication of where they're going to be in the future because they're moving every quarter. But anyway, it's been 3 quarters now that we've been well ahead of United, but we don't take huge comfort in that. There's just tons of noise in there.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughts, Doug.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody and thank you very much for the time this morning. As you guys start to think about opportunities to grow the network, where do you think the next \u2013 and as the new aircraft come in? Because I think you're still getting a few new aircraft, especially 787s. Where do you think the next best markets are for those aircraft?\nRobert Isom: Helane, thanks. I'll start, and Vasu can add on. So look, we've done some great work to put in place some new partnerships that have been talked about. That allows us to really optimize the fleet overall. And as we take a look at the growth, you'll see that some of the things I talked about, new gates in Charlotte, new gates at DFW, the upgauging of 14 regional gates in DCA, those are going to be first on the list for us. And we're really happy with the set of assets that we have, because they do enable us for some growth in some of the fastest-growing metro areas. But in addition to that, they are really efficient connecting operations as well. So that's first order of business. Vasu?\nVasu Raja: Yes. Robert said it really well. And what I'd say very simply is, some of this pandemic and everything we've seen for the vast majority of cities all across domestic U.S. and even South America, too, the American Airlines has the best network, the best globally ubiquitous network. And -- so, we envisioned a lot of where we would organically put assets is there. And then as we start building back international, we built it back in a way where it really grows off of where we're strongest organically, places like Chicago and Philadelphia and Miami and Dallas-Fort Worth. But also we envision being able to launch flights out of New York and Seattle. And we've been really encouraged so far with what we've seen through those partnerships. So a big chunk of our growth, wherever it is, is going to be focused on things that really drive the performance of this company and are positive for us and our customers.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Vasu and Robert. And then the other question I had and I think you may have answered this, but I might have missed it. Is the revenue being driven by higher load factors or higher yields or a combination thereof?\nVasu Raja: Yes, Helane, this is Vasu again. And the reality is both. But as we go back and look at -- look at this, when we look at it internally, we actually index at March 2020 when things kind of were at their lowest point. And if you look at that and just index our results coming out of there, our traffic -- like our traffic just slowly filled capacity. And the next thing -- the next effect that we've been seeing, as you look at that sequentially, is growth in yield. So the reality is both, but what we have been more encouraged about, to my earlier comments, too, is that, as we get into peak days of week peak travel period, things like that, we are able to go and drive yields in a way that really was nonexistent to us in 2020. So the reality is it's both, but increasingly, yields are taking over. And that's very encouraging for us because, of course, in the way our ASMs are distributed, the more and more we see domestic yield recoveries, the more our business has large recoveries.\nHelane Becker: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Hey. Just two here. Robert, I want to go back to the point that you made about a full business travel recovery in 2022. Now are you specifically referring to your domestic business revenue, which I think is about 25%? Are we looking at, on a system-wide basis, which is probably a number that's probably 10 to 15 percentage points higher than that. I just want a clarification on that.\nRobert Isom: Hey, Mike, domestic.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nRobert Isom: International, as we said in our comments is still ways off. But as Vasu and Alison have talked, everything we see in terms of trends from a domestic business perspective and boding-well for international as well as we go out and we talk to CEOs and in insurance and in financials and in consulting and accounting firms, everything tells us that business is going to come back to where we had seen it before. Maybe in some different ways, but feel really confident starting with domestic in 2022.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Very helpful. And then I just -- Vasu, I want to ask you, not that long ago, I want to say a few months back, I think you were out publicly saying that you were bracing for maybe a bit of a falloff in demand when we got into the fall largely kids back-to-school, families or parents back to work that you would see some impact on one hand. On the other hand, when you think about maybe Europeans coming to the U.S. getting pushed back into the fall, the cruise industry just starting to reopen, Broadway opens, I think, on September 14th, are we going to see a potential leisure bump because of just re-openings that are happening around the world? And have you rethought that prognostication about a potential demand sluggishness maybe on the leisure side when we get into September, October. What's your latest thoughts on that? Thank you.\nVasu Raja: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Well, let me clarify my prognostication. I think it's taken on colors that I didn't originally meet it for the investor conference. But really, what it is, is that first and foremost is long-haul international, consistent with Robert's comments a moment ago. Right now, as I'll use Europe as the example, as markets there have reopened, we saw a lot of bookings come in, what would be historically late in the European booking curve, which is great. But the vast majority of them are sales represent relative style bookings, or leisure-oriented bookings. And so as we look out there, there's really not a lot to indicate that real long-haul business travel is going to be coming back following Labor Day. And again, to continue my European example, really what buffers the European network into the fall is indeed business travel. Now what is unknown to us is if these reopenings continue, there probably is going to be some more marginal demand for Europeans coming to leisure markets in the U.S. and Latin America. But for all intents and purposes, we're presuming that, that's going to be relatively small. We've seen very little to occur otherwise or to comments Alison made and Robert made. And then as we think about our short-haul network, both in domestic and added Mexico, Caribbean and Latin America, there, we do indeed anticipate that visiting friends and relatives style markets will actually be seasonally and sequentially stronger than what it would have been in 2019 or 2018. We do anticipate there's going to be more weekend-oriented leisure demand, three-day weekends, things like that than what we might have otherwise seen. But the reality is what we have in June and what there's going to be in September is likely to be really different. Right now in June, we see travel where people will go to Missoula, Montana on a Tuesday and return the following Wednesday. It's pretty unlikely that a trip like that is going to happen with the same degree of frequency when you get -- when people are going back to school. But that's okay, we can go and configure our airline network to go and match the demand that's there. And that's indeed why certainly in our published schedule, you see us flying more things into D.C. and New York and starting to add back multi-frequency business markets and in three-day weekend patterns and things like that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. You may now ask your question.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. My first question related to when Broadway is going to open, but might be busy lunch. So a question probably for Robert. So the third quarter capacity guide down 15% to 20%. That's a bit more aggressive than some of your competitors. It is what it is. But what internal calculus went into that. I mean, is that a function of loss minimization. Is it driven by the maximum amount of staffing that you have particularly on the pilot side, is that what you need to operate to avoid ceding share to competitors, just curious why that figure is down 15% to 20% as opposed to something different?\nRobert Isom: I'll start, and Derek can join in as well. But look, we're planning the airline for where demand is. We're planning the airline to maximize profitability. And it doesn't make sense right now to have assets on the ground. We've got the staff to go out and fly them. And we think that what we're doing is, is profit maximizing for \u2013 or loss minimizing for the airline right now. Vasu, go ahead.\nVasu Raja: Yes. Jamie, this is Vasu. I'll pick up right where Robert left off. He's exactly right. We plan to maximize the marginal economics of the business. And you see that. This is \u2013 a lot of what we see in Q3 is extension, quite frankly, of Q2. So if you look at Q2, for example, I was reading through other airlines print. And for the best-performing airline, their domestic PRASM, we produced the exact same domestic PRASM they did, but our airline was 65% or 70% larger or 6% [ph] more capacity. So to be able to be that much larger and produce the exact same revenue is a really, really great marginal economic decision because in our system, we're able to go and create that kind of leverage. And so the only difference between for us flying at 80 and something more or less than that is the \u2013 as we go out there, it's a continuation. And you can see it in the published schedules of exactly what's there right now, where about 90-ish percent of the ASM capacity of the company is doing the things that are really working right now, which is flying a lot in the Americas, both in North and South America, of the remaining 10% is flying Transatlantic and Transpacific. And that's the best marginal economic decision to make right now. And should that change? We have ample ways to go and respond to that.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That's helpful. And then on Slide 16, you talked about steady state CapEx. I think the problem American had and I guess now the challenge United is facing is that CapEx really runs through peaks and valleys. So sort of a theoretical question. Is there a way to smooth those trends over time, or are airlines simply perpetually beholden to the product cycle from the OEMs? I'm trying to understand if $3 billion is truly a steady state number, or if that's just shorthand for short-term run rate until the next cool sunny thing comes along? That's my question.\nDoug Parker: No. Jamie, I was going to say, I think it maybe fluctuate up and down, a little bit on that, but you know, if you have a \u2013 to not get into the state of where we did before where we had $5 billion, $6 billion, and we were taking 100 aircraft, a year, we need to try to smooth it out a little bit better. But the other way to do that is take that -- take new aircraft, take older aircrafts, do different things like that. So, as you look at that, but we're to take -- I don\u2019t think there's anything to do with manufacturers. It has to do with how do we want to smooth things out over the next 20, 25 years from an aircraft capital perspective because, as you know, aircraft, they can only last a certain point in time. So, our view is that we're going to need to replace some each year. We're going to need a little bit for growth each year, and that's where that CapEx comes from. I don't -- yes, it's harder to go, okay, we're going to order a bunch and get them all within a three or five-year period. We'd like to smooth that out a little bit more. So Doug, do you have anything to add to that?\nDoug Parker: I was just going to add, Jamie, that I think what you're seeing is that pent-up replacement issue that's driving this right now largely. So, given what's happening is airlines need to eventually replace aircraft, of course. And American did that pretty margin America deal with a big order, whenever that was, 2012 or 2013. US Airways already was in the middle of that. So combined, that's why we do have the debt. We have because we have much newer and better aircraft and assets than some of our competitors, and they now have to go through the same thing. So -- and while we were going through the troubles of the industry was going through, people held on to airplanes longer than we have in the past. So, all things -- anything related to the OEMs and entirely related to airlines who now have just held on to airplanes long enough that they have to be released. American's is not in the situation anymore. You know Delta are. And so you're seeing us now with lower CapEx in the future. You'll see them with larger in the future. That's the cycle. But once we get through that, you'll see us all get to, as Derek said, much more steady and kind of adding capital for growth as opposed to adding capital for replacement.\nOperator: And then your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Thank you. Good morning. By the way, Doug, that aircraft order was almost 10 years ago almost to the day, by the way.\nDoug Parker: Wow.\nHunter Keay: I know. Time flies. I know. Derek, are you planning on revenue in 2022 to be above or below 2019?\nDerek Kerr: Revenue above or below 2019?\nHunter Keay: Yes.\nDerek Kerr: Above. What do you guys think?\nDoug Parker: Above.\nHunter Keay: I just want to clarify that question. You're planning on 2022 revenue to be above 2019?\nDerek Kerr: Number one, we haven't done our plan yet. So, a number -- so we haven't figured out -- I do -- I think from a -- what we do know is we will probably have growth a little bit. We should be back to 2019 levels from a growth perspective in 2022. CASM should be lower than where we are from a 2019 perspective, and revenue is going to be dependent on the recovery. So, I would -- I will take back my comment and just say it depends on the corporate recovery, it depends on international coming back to see whether we can get to that level. But I do know from a cost perspective and a planning perspective from an ASM, we would plan to be pretty close to 2019 levels. From an ASM perspective and CASM, pretty flat on those levels.\nHunter Keay: Okay. All right, cool. And then another question for you, Derek. On the $1.5 billion in gross CapEx next year and I think you said $1.8 billion in '23, is there a 787 gross CapEx in that, or are those just operating leases? And what is the latest on the expectation of timing and delivery on those 19 planes? Thanks.\nDerek Kerr: Yes. The 787, there's -- the only gross CapEx. We only have a few left in 2022. So there's no gross CapEx in that number. That's all other than x 787. We have 14, 788s that are \u2013 13 that are still left to deliver this year, but 8 of them are delayed at this point in time. So we really don't know the timing of those coming. 12 of them were supposed to come in 2021 -- or 11, excuse me, were supposed to come in 2021 and only 2 in 2022. So the CapEx for those 2 aircraft is very small in 2022. And as you noted, we do have sale-leaseback financing, and they're all financed in there. So the CapEx would be very minimal. We're still working with Boeing on those deliveries. Unfortunately, a lot of them were delayed. We don't quite know when they'll come in, but we're working with Boeing to try to get those. And we'd like to get them as soon as possible, but I know they're having issues trying to get those aircraft out.\nHunter Keay: Got it. Thanks Derek.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Connor Cunningham with MKM Partners. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 ConnorCunningham: Hi everyone. Thanks for the time. This might be a strange question. But does your acceleration of debt paydown allow you to be a little bit more aggressive with your network. Those things then pushed back in the past just like that your debt burden has hurt you guys are being a little bit more tactical. So I'm just curious if you can be, if you're going to be more nimble kind of going forward as you start to repay debt?\nDoug Parker: Yes. Thanks for asking anyway. I can't think of one decision we've ever made around here that we said, 'Oh, we can't do that because we have more of that.' Indeed, we haven't made one. So not to extend the thought we are being less nimble because we are burned with we certainly ever felt so. So, what we have or we \u2013 prior to 2020, as I stated, given the fleet modernization, the airline has gone through a fairly rapid fleet modernization the airline had gone through, we got to a position where we had more debt on the balance sheet than we thought made sense on a going-forward basis. So we had stepped forward a plan to reduce that debt over time. As we went into 2020, the pandemic obviously not only delayed the ability to do that, but made it even -- just added more to that as we had to add debt to fund operating losses. So now that we can begin to rebuild our efforts, we're excited that we're going to do that. But not one decision that we stepped gosh, we can't grow. We can't do what others are doing. We can't do what we want to do because we have a debt burden.' We've never found ourselves in a situation where we couldn't go finance more, if we need, if we wanted to or invest in the business where we wanted to, and we've been doing that and is certainly the case going forward.\nQ \u2013 ConnorCunningham: Great. And then just a couple of months ago, you were at a conference \u2013 or I think it was Vasu that was there. And you talked about how you weren't going to bring back international less the returns or similar to your domestic market. And I thought that was somewhat interesting. So, should we assume that the 60/35 split that you've historically had is going to skew more domestic on the other -- well, I mean, obviously, when things start to normalize and everything is open, like how do you view your international network going forward?\nVasu Raja: Hey, this is Vasu, and thanks for the question, and I'll clarify that. To my earlier comments, this pandemic was a big reset for us. And prior to the pandemic, our margins internationally were -- certainly trailed our competitors and struggled a lot, especially outside of the time we got to peak summer. And a big part of it was that we had a lot of widebodies that, though they were put to really good use in the summer, really could not earn their carrying costs as we got in the trough season. A major part of that is that we didn't have big gateways in markets such as New York or the West Coast to be able to launch flights. A big part of it was just the nature of the unique and very expense and small fleet of widebodies that we have. And so when we -- when I say that a lot of coming back -- or a lot of what the pandemic has been changing that materially. We have some 80 fewer wide-body-capable -- or long-haul capable airplanes in the fleet as we enter the fourth quarter. And as we start to go and build it back, the things that we're focused on, things that can produce real annual returns much as we do with our short haul and narrow-body fleet. And we're seeing that increasingly as you go out there. If you look out at our -- just in published schedules, we've never been larger in Mexico, Caribbean and Latin America. Indeed, we are almost twice as large as any of our traditional network competitors in the area, and we see more opportunities to be able to grow. Indeed, were it not for restrictions on customer entry, we'd be a lot bigger in just about every one of the countries in South America than what we are today. Similarly, we see a lot of opportunities through partnerships that we've envisioned and created since the pandemic with -- not just with JetBlue and Alaska, which create really great jump-off points for international, but also with Qatar Airways, who's very quickly become our largest long-haul codeshare partner. And we think that will continue beyond and do that partnership that will open up new markets for us that wouldn't have been viable for our customers or for us financially prior to this. So when we talk about bringing it back, we do anticipate growing in long haul, but we need to be able to grow in long haul where we can earn the kind of returns that we earn in the domestic business.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take media question. [Operator Instructions] All right. And your first question comes from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Your line is open.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi. Thanks everyone for taking my questions. When you started this big hiring push in the last few months, are those employees coming in at lower average pay rates for the people that left the company to buyouts, et cetera? And then can you talk a little bit about the booking pace for post-peak summer? I think someone mentioned 35% for September. I wasn't sure if that was just business travel or what. And then through the end of the year, what you're seeing there? Thanks.\nDoug Parker: Hey, Leslie, it's Doug. I'll take the first one. Indeed, yes, the people come back will come in by definition at lower pay rates. Still very high pay rates, by the way. But yes, we're 90% united [ph], so they come in on a union. On the contract scale is based upon seniorities. So people are coming back on lower seniorities. They come in at the lower end of that scale and progressing throughout -- progressing on through time. Second one?\nVasu Raja: Yeah. Leslie, could you just repeat that question? I want to make sure I understood it right. This is Vasu.\nLeslie Josephs: Yes. If you can just give some detail on what you're seeing with bookings post the peak summer period. So I don't know if that's like half mid-August and then through the ends of the year. I think you had mentioned before, 35% for September. I don't know if that's 35% booked network-wide or just business travel or what you compared to [Indiscernible]\nVasu Raja: Yeah. Okay, thank you for that. That context is super helpful. Yeah, look, we're continuing to be encouraged by the booking trends that we see. September, of course, as we go beyond Labor Day, September is our most booked month, and it's booked at about 35% full. That's not all that surprising to us. And in fact, it's by design, because, for us, at this point, though booking curves have expanded, still about 50% to 60% of our demand comes in inside of 45 days. So it's going to be a while before we really see how the booking curve shapes up. But we are very much encouraged at what we see. We think that traffic will continue to recover. And critically, we've been encouraged that as markets reopen, as companies return to work, then shortly thereafter, business travel comes back, especially business travel for short-haul sectors. So we're encouraged as we go Labor Day and beyond and cautiously optimistic for what lies head.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thanks.\nVasu Raja: Thanks, Leslie.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Your line is open.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could give us an update on your vendor staffing situation. I think you had talked before about maybe having shortfalls on provisioning and perhaps airport employees in certain job categories. And I wanted to see if you could give us the current status of that, and whether you're still asking employees to volunteer for any jobs.\nRobert Isom: Mary, thanks. It's Robert. So, hey, the great news is that we're running a really nice operation in July. And so some of the places that were the most difficult to hire in and some of the things you speak of, like catering and people that assist with wheel shares, we've had really great luck with our vendors to get back on track. And so, when we take a look at the catering issues, we're right where we need to be. We have the airport staffed fully above and below the wing. And we're going to keep it that way. So we've been working closely with our vendors and feel good about it.\nMary Schlangenstein: So are you then not having any further issues, especially as pertains to the catering on your aircraft? I mean, is that back to 100%?\nRobert Isom: So, yeah, we're back to where we need to be. As I said, there's always issues in certain places throughout the system, but we've -- we're running the airline that we need to right now. And as I said, we're going to -- we'll continue to work with vendors on any potential shortfall. Certainly, from an airline perspective, American has a great ability to attract team members. We pay great wages and have great contracts and benefits. And so, we've been able to get back to where we need to go. And June was a month in which we saw the issues associated with trying to ramp up as quickly as we did, but we've addressed those, and we're on the right track.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.\nAlison Sider: Hi, thanks. One of your competitors has started talking about focusing more on the premium side of the business. And I guess, just given that, I'm curious, where you see yourselves like positioned? And whether you have any concerns about your product? And specifically, seatback screens, if there's been any regret about taking those off or any reevaluation of that?\nRobert Isom: Okay. I can start, and we can all chime in here. But I'd really like to focus on what we've done, which is really exciting. Over the last five years or so we've brought in, nearly 600 new aircraft so, while others may be talking about, what they might do, we have that on. We've already brought that in. And as well, any \u2013 in our narrow-bodies, we talked about with our 737 and A320 category configuration programs, that's all about making whatever else wasn't already new go back into really great shape. We've done a similar thing on the regional side where we brought in new double class, dual class RJs, especially the E175s, which get a really great reviews from our customers. And with all that, we've had an attention to making sure that we've got the right product, no matter where it's at in the cabin. We were one of the first carriers to get out there and provision our wide-body aircraft with premium economy seats, which is some of the most profitable real estate on the aircraft. Alison, as we take a look going forward. In regard to the product in-flight, we feel really good about focusing on what customers want most. And so to that end, we were the first in the business to get out and make sure that our aircraft are equipped with the highest-speed WiFi, satellite WiFi that offers full streaming capability on our narrow-body -- on all our narrow-body aircraft. We've got it on our WiFi-ed aircraft as well. Even on our 2 class regionals, we have ground-based WiFi. So we feel great about that because customers have said, 'We want to stay connected in flight.' And as we take a look going forward, we're intent on making sure that our store content product on the aircraft offers customers the ability to pull whatever they want to. And we're also going to be getting back into live entertainment as well. So from a technology perspective, we know that customers bring \u2013 just virtually everybody, 90% of our customers bring their own devices. Those devices have capabilities and higher definition in terms of screen capabilities, then we can put on aircraft right now. And as we take a look going forward, we're going to stay abreast of whatever it is that our customers need. And every day that we take a look going forward, technology improves. And we're going to be at the forefront of whatever comes. So right now, we feel really good about where we're at. I like what our product does for customers. I like what it means from a sustainability perspective, what we're doing in terms of our in-flight entertainment and making it satellite and WiFi-based. It's lighter. It's more efficient. And ultimately, it can keep up to speed with what customers want. So we feel really good about it.\nAlison Sider: Thanks.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Alison.\nOperator: And your next question comes from David Koenig with Associated Press. Your line is open.\nDavid Koenig: Hi. Hi, everybody. Hey, Robert and Vasu and Alison touched on this. But I wonder on business fares, if you have tried -- in business travel, I wonder if you can say whether business yields -- whether business passengers will be paying the same level of fares they paid before the pandemic or something more or less and how quickly that's going to happen?\nVasu Raja: Dave, this is Vasu. And the short answer to your question is that right now, what we observe, business customers are paying a similar fare. But very importantly, as we're building this airline, we want to make it as easy as possible for our customers to return to travel and fly with us. And that means that the more value we give them through our product, the more willing they are to go and pay more for the product. And so while fare is the same, the reality is that the product that the business customer is going to come back to you in the fall is going to be way different. And for us, the big part of the product is the network. And the network that we'll be selling and marketing to customers, which is not just flight AA flies, but those that JetBlue flies and Alaska and Gol and Qatar Airways, in just North and South America alone, that network is two times larger than what any of our competitors offer. So, that's already a much more compelling thing. And so the simple way to think of it is for paying the same payer in 2019, you get a much more expansive network. And we are working really, really actively and diligently to ensure that that's delivered in the most reliable way in a way that's really easy for customers to go and understand and do business with.\nDavid Koenig: I guess I was wondering if you're having to offer concessions on price to bring them back.\nAlison Taylor: No. No, that's not been part of it. For us, it's about building confidence and returning to travel and make it easy for them to book and have their travel journey with us. And so we work with all our travel partners and with travel managers to get that done.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Your line is open.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi, good morning. This question is for Doug or Robert. I'm wondering if you could give us an update on what you're hearing on the federal mask mandate? And whether the tone of those conversations have changed given the spike in cases? And also, I'm curious as to what your stance is on that? Do you think it should stay or be lifted? Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Dawn, it's Doug. So, we're -- we haven't been involved in any conversation. The mandate is in place through September 13. It's put in place by the federal government that gets a specifically. And that's where we stand today. I don't know if -- what their view is on to whether it will be extended or whether they will let it expire on September 13. Whatever they decide, we'll enforce. And we'll continue to do so. It's not for us to opine as to whether or not it should be extended or not. That's their job. It's a federal mandate, and we will enforce whatever they put in place.\nDawn Gilbertson: If I could do one quick follow-up. Say, you lifted, Vasu or anybody, is there any concern at all if it's lifted that especially as we look ahead to holiday travel that maybe families with -- that could hurt bookings with families with unvaccinated children that maybe don't want to get on an airplane without a mask mandate?\nDoug Parker: Yes, we're not going to speculate on that. We don't know if it's going to look or not. I don't -- again, I -- we certainly haven't seen any -- seen or heard any of our customers indicate that they have any sort of use. So, we certainly don't know, but it's really hard to speculate on something until we get to that line.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Edward Russell with Skift. Your line is open.\nEdward Russell: Hi, thank you. I was wondering, Doug, if you could comment on the American view of the payroll support program. Are those coming off? I know last year, you were talking about how it would allow American keeping staff, as well as ramp up quickly in the recovery, yet we've seen some operational issues this summer. So I just wanted to get your view on the relative success or otherwise of the program?\nDoug Parker: Yes. I think it's an overwhelming success. And to the extent there have been issues on growth, I think those are indicative of how successful the program was. Because had it not been for a PSP, you wouldn't see airlines trying to grow like we are 45% in the quarter. You're going to see airlines shut down and it's an industry shutdown. And I don't know when \u2013 where we'd be at this point. I don't know where we'd be in terms of our economy at this point. But it literally could not have been able to continue flying virtually the entire industry without the support of the Cares program. And by having it in place and by keeping it in place as the pandemic continued, what it allowed all of us to do was to keep our team employed. Now they went off flying, of course, but they're being paid. We were being paid to pay them at our government. So as we needed, we need to, of course, get them back into training. But they were ramped down and void, getting put back into training. And there were people that were on leave that we have recalled from leave. So, if it weren't for PSP, no that wouldn't make it. Obviously, it would flow have been not looking for the new employees as they would have gone up to do other things. I can't imagine how relative it would be, in terms of not just the airline industry but for our entire economy, if it weren't for the PSP program and what it did to maintain the infrastructure necessary to meet the demand that's down here.\nEdward Russell: Great. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And that concludes the media question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker, for any closing remarks.\nDoug Parker: Okay. Thanks, everybody. Just -- look, we are just really excited about the momentum we're seeing. It's in the numbers that you see today, 87% of revenue growth versus last quarter, 45% ASM growth versus last quarter; cash of $21 billion, 3x where it was when we ended 2019. And that continues into \u2013 and it continue into this quarter. And we just couldn't they're doing to take care of people. And I just -- I can't think of a better indicator of how quickly and drastically the world has changed to the point out that American Airlines today prepaid $1 billion of low interest notes that aren't due for 2 more years, after all we've been through for the last year or so, looking to go raise money wherever we could to make sure we had enough to fund the operating losses that we saw going forward. We've now got ourselves to a position where we're using cash to pay off debt that doesn't come due for 2 more years. It feels really good. And so we're excited about where we are. We're really excited about the future, and we look forward to talking to you as we go forward. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.\nDaniel Cravens: Thanks, Crystal. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call this morning, we have Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call for our question-and-answer session are several of our senior executives including Maya Leibman, Steve Johnson, Vasu Raja, Alison Taylor and Devon May. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and the actions we've taken during this pandemic. Robert will then follow with some remarks about our commercial and other strategic initiatives. After Robert's remarks, Derek will follow with the details on the quarter and our operating plans going forward. After Derek's comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions, and lastly, questions from the media. [Operator Instructions]. Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast, capacity, fleet plans and liquidity. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financials is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website, and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. This morning, we reported a first quarter pretax loss, excluding net special items of $3.5 billion. The loss was driven, of course, by the extreme drop in demand for air travel due to the global pandemic. Our revenues in the quarter were down 62% from the same period in 2019. In the midst of this difficult environment, the American Airlines team produced remarkable results. We flew more customers than any other U.S. airline. We did so reliably and safe. We produced the highest passenger unit revenue of any global U.S. carrier while having more available seats for sale. We completed the largest financing in airline history, a $10 billion transaction, secured by the most valuable loyalty program in the world, the AAdvantage frequent flyer program. And excluding debt principal, we were cash positive in the month of March, our first such month since the beginning of the pandemic. These results and more were made possible by our incredible team. Without their resiliency, creativity and compassion, we'd be facing a very difficult future. Instead, thanks to their hard work and determination, we're starting to see light at the end of this very long tunnel - this very dark tunnel, and we're on a path that has us well positioned as demand for air travel returns. That path forward is guided by what we're calling our green flag plan. For our industry, this pandemic has been much like a yellow flag during an auto race, where everyone slows down, takes a pit stop and get their cars ready for when the race resumes at full speed. We've used this period to improve and prepare our airline, so that when the green flag does drop, which appears to be on the horizon American will be ready. That plan is centered on four initiatives. I'll take a minute to walk through those at a high level, and then Robert and Derek will expand on what we've achieved to date and what we see on the horizon. First, we're doubling down on our commitment to operational excellence. We had a great operation in the first quarter, carrying more than 24 million passengers on nearly 340,000 flights. During our busiest day of the quarter, we had more than 430,000 customers flying on our aircraft. That's the highest we've had since March 2020. Our goal is to run the most reliable operation at American Airlines history once everyone is back to a full schedule. And the steps we put in place, including more reliable yet profitable scheduling, new tools and technology to assist our team and customers during irregular operations and our [clean] (ph) commitment, will ensure we achieve that goal. Second, we're taking this opportunity to reconnect with our customers. Robert will talk more about all we're doing. As customers return to the skies, they will see an even better American Airlines. One with the broadest and best global network that\u2019s now been enhanced by new partnerships. And one with innovative technologies and procedures that make travel more convenient for our customers and ensures they feel safe and comfortable as they return to fly. Third, we're planning to build on the positive momentum we've established with our team. This past year has tested our team in ways we could not have imagined, but it also brought us much closer. We worked hand-in-hand with our union leaders to ensure that team members felt cared for, even as we experienced by far the most difficult financial circumstances in our industry's history. We're committed to building on that progress and continue to work together to ensure our team feels cared for every day. On that note, we are very happy to tell 13,000 team members they could tear up their WARN notices, following the passage of the COVID-19 Relief Act that included an extension of the payroll support program. We will continue to welcome team members back to the operations as we increase our schedule. In fact, earlier this week, we announced we will begin hiring pilots later this year to prepare for 2022 and beyond. Finally and importantly, we are committed to passionately driving efficiencies across the organization. Derek will elaborate on this. But we are really proud of the aggressive and innovative ways the team has worked to position us to be more efficient on the other side of this pandemic. The efficiencies we've built into the business over the past year will drive more than $1.3 billion of permanent non-volume-related savings in 2021 and beyond. So before I turn it over to Robert, I'll close with this. We are a long way from where we need to be. This crisis is far from over, and we have to continue fighting to give our customers, shareholders and team the company they deserve. But there is no doubt, the pace of the recovery is accelerating. And thanks to our team, in a thoughtful and proactive plan as the green flag drops, American Airlines is ready.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I also want to thank our entire team for everything that they've done for our airline throughout the pandemic. This phenomenal group continues to rise to the occasion and deliver for our customers every day, and we're incredibly grateful. Our first quarter revenue of $4 billion was effectively flat on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2020. However, our demand and revenue trends accelerated significantly as the quarter progressed. In January, our total revenue was 34% of what it was in 2019. And by March, it was 46% in 2019. This trend was driven by strong leisure demand in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin America. This momentum has continued as our 7-day rolling average of system daily net bookings has reached 2019 levels this week. And this is in spite of business and long-haul international demand remaining weak, with net bookings of roughly 20% of their 2019 levels. That said, there are early signs of recovery for business. Small business demand, which was roughly 17% of our system revenue has been improving steadily as vaccination rates have increased and as markets reopen. An increasing number of our largest corporate accounts are coming back to the office and indicating that they'll be traveling in the third quarter and confirming in-person board meetings, conferences and events for this year. Importantly, we're focused on turning improved bookings and load factors into a leading unit revenue performance. We have continued to shape our network and our customer experience as nimbly and thoughtfully as possible, and we're seeing the results. The first quarter of 2021 was the third consecutive quarter in which our passenger unit revenue materially outperformed each of our network competitors. Thanks to our team, our likelihood to recommend scores have improved for the last 3 quarters as well. Based on our results in the first quarter, we're on track to have our best LTR year since the merger. We have used the pandemic to reset our airlines that it consistently outperforms for our customers, our team and investors. The first sign of this is in our summer schedule and second quarter capacity plan. We expect to fly approximately 80% of our 2019 system seat capacity in the second quarter, and this increases to 90% this summer. We'll continue to [Indiscernible] largest share of our assets to market where we can create unique value for our customers, and therefore, generate passenger unit revenue premium relative to our competition. When compared to 2019, we expect to find 90% of our domestic seat capacity during the summer peak and 100% in DFW and Charlotte. Our domestic network will constitute 85% of our system seat capacity in the summer peak. We expect to operate 80% of our international seat capacity compared to 2019 in our peak. Our organic network in the Americas creates more unique choices for customers and more profitability for the airline. As such, in our summer peak, our Latin American network is expected to be the same size as it was in 2019. Our short and long-haul Latin America network will constitute approximately 12% of our system seat capacity in the summer peak. By contrast, our operation has been much more challenged in the Atlantic and Pacific as those markets have yet to fully reopen. And as a result, in our peak schedule, seat capacity in those parts of our network will only be 40% of what it was during the same period in 2019. Our Atlantic and Pacific networks will constitute just 3% of our system seat capacity in the summer peak. We expect to bring these markets back slowly and only when demand conditions warrant. It's important to note there is significant pent-up demand for international travel, and we're seeing it most in markets like Tel Aviv and Athens where market reopenings are leading to steady increases in demand. As borders continue to open throughout the world, we'll be ready because of the changes that we made to our fleet and network and the strength of our partnerships around the world. Overall, we will deliver any increase in capacity in a more efficient and reliable fashion than we did in 2019. We've accelerated the retirement of over 150 older aircraft in our fleet, leaving American with by far the youngest fleet of our global U.S. competitors. We intend to have all of our remaining aircraft active this summer and no longer sitting out on tarmacs around the country. As Derek will share in a few minutes, we'll soon complete the harmonization of our Boeing 737 and Airbus A321 fleet, driving superior cost efficiency, a simpler operation and a better customer experience. Just as we used the past year to adapt our fleet network, we have also developed partnerships to offer our customers a seamless network in markets where we have structurally underperformed. This has been most true on the West Coast and in the Northeast. We have been unable to grow these markets organically due to infrastructure constraints. However, through our recently announced partnerships with Alaska and JetBlue, we can now offer customers the largest network in these 2 regions and bring a level of competition and choice that has long been lacking. Of course, to make these partnerships work, the experience must be seamless for our customers. As we like to say, an elite customer anywhere should be treated as an elite customer everywhere. We have several initiatives underway to make that a reality, including our announcement just yesterday to deliver on the next phase of our partnership with JetBlue. As we look towards the recovery, reconnecting with our customers will be centered on being the easiest airline to do business with. Our goal has always been to remove as many friction points as possible, and in the first quarter, we took a number of steps to help simplify the travel experience for customers as they return to flying. We've enhanced our travel planning tool to help customers make informed decisions on where they travel and what to expect when they get there, add a new pre-flight COVID-19 testing options, expanded acceptance of VeriFLY, the mobile health wallet that simplifies and verifies travel requirements. VeriFLY is now accepted for all of our international flights in the U.S. to the U.S. and our flights from the U.S. to 11 countries. Our partners, Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, Japan Airlines, now also accept VeriFLY. Building a curb to gate contactless journey will be an ongoing effort as we reimagine safe and convenient travel in a post-COVID era. At DFW, we have expanded our touch technology trial to allow customers to use biometric scanners to check their bag's prior to departure, and we'll utilize that same technology to allow customers to gain entrance to an Admirals Club lounge later this year. And today, as we celebrate Earth Day, I want to highlight some important strides we've made to run a more sustainable airline. The most important thing any airline can do is retire older aircraft and replace them with new, more fuel-efficient aircraft. And we've done that at American, with $24 billion of investment over the past 7 years and a retirement of more than 650 older aircraft. But we need to do more to reach our goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and we have our eye on sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is the most promising advancement available to us in the near to mid-term. We've been taking delivery of SAF for almost a year, and in the first quarter, we reached innovative offsetting agreements with 2 of our customers, Deloitte and Kuehne+Nagel. We appreciate that the Biden administration and many in Congress have engaged with our industry on climate issues or encouraged by the fact that we have common goals, especially when it comes to SAF. So in summary, over the past year, we've greatly simplified and modernized our fleet, rationalized our network and made many changes to our business and operations to ensure customers have flexibility and peace of mind when they return to travel. We're encouraged by the trends in demand for air travel across all sectors and believe American is well-positioned for the recovery in the months and years ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I too want to take the opportunity to thank our team. Their leadership and hard work truly embodies what American Airlines team members are known for. This morning, we reported a first quarter GAAP net loss of $1.3 billion or $1.97 per share. Excluding net special credits, we reported a net loss of $2.7 billion or $4.32 per share. Robert talked about many of the commercial activities we're working on and the trends we're seeing in the demand environment, so I'll focus my remarks on the cost side of our P&L and our balance sheet as we look to the future. Throughout the entire pandemic, we have remained focused on keeping our capacity aligned with demand while preserving the maximum amount of flexibility to respond as demand returns. We took aggressive actions to reduce our cost structure, and we have reduced our first quarter total operating expense, excluding net special items, by 26% versus 2020 on a 39% reduction in total capacity. Nonfuel operating expenses, excluding net special credits, were up 6% sequentially from the fourth quarter as we gradually added back capacity. We ended the first quarter with $17.3 billion in total available liquidity, including approximately $3.1 billion of PSP2 funds we received from the Treasury Department during the quarter. We were recently notified that this amount will be increased by approximately $463 million to be received in the second quarter. In addition, we expect to receive $3.3 billion of PSP3 funds by the end of the second quarter. We saw positive trends in our daily cash burn rate throughout the quarter. Our average daily cash burn was approximately $27 million per day, which came in better than our guidance of $30 million per day. This happened despite the drop-off in demand we saw in January and February and a significant increase in fuel prices at the beginning of the quarter. As a reminder, our definition of cash burn includes approximately $9 million per day of regular debt principal and cash severance payments. For the month of March, our estimated average daily cash burn rate was approximately $4 million per day. And excluding approximately $8 million per day of regular debt principal and cash severance payments made in March. As Doug noted, the company's cash burn rate turned positive for the month. During the quarter, our Treasury team did a phenomenal job of continuing to strengthen our liquidity through a series of capital market transactions. Notably, we completed our $10 billion financing transaction that was backed by the AAdvantage program at a blended rate of 5.6%, less than half of what we would have been able to do last summer, and use those proceeds to repay in full the $550 million secured loan we had with the Treasury Department. We also had $530 million of aircraft amortization payments, including the maturity of our 2011-1WTC, which, together with mortgage maturities, resulted in 35 mainline aircraft and 9 regional aircraft becoming unencumbered. During the quarter, we also repaid in full our $2.8 billion of revolving credit facilities. This was a liquidity-neutral transaction that reduced the company's outstanding debt by $2.8 billion. Importantly, we still retain the flexibility to either draw upon these revolving commitments again as needed or leave them undrawn until October 2024. During the quarter, we took delivery of 7 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, and we expect to take 1 more delivery later this year. As a reminder, these aircraft were built while the MAX was grounded and were efficiently financed through leasing transactions. In addition, we recently exercised our remaining deferral rights on 18 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft that were previously scheduled to be delivered in 2021 and 2022. These deliveries are now expected to occur in 2023 and 2024. Lastly, we reached an agreement with Boeing related to our remaining 787-8 deliveries. Under the revised terms of the agreement, we have elected to defer and convert 5 787-8 aircraft to 787-9 aircraft. These deliveries are now expected to occur in 2023. The remaining 14 deliveries of 787-8 aircraft have been rescheduled to occur by the end of the first quarter of 2022, and all of these aircraft will retain their existing financings. In January, the company made $241 million in contributions to its pension plans and marks the new COVID-19 relief bill, included, among other things, funding relief for single employer pension plans. These new funding rules reduced the company's remaining required cash contribution for 2021 to 0, while lowering our projected required contributions over the next 5 years by over $2 billion. Under these new provisions for funding purposes, the combined plans are expected to be funded in excess of 90% for plan year 2021. As Doug and Robert mentioned, we are starting to see signs of what appears to be a strong economic recovery. This fantastic news makes our $1.3 billion of efficiency measures even more important as we repair our business for the return to a more normal environment. On the fleet side, we have talked a lot about our fleet simplification efforts and the elimination of smaller sub-fleets, which resulted in the removal of more than 150 older and inefficient aircraft. Many of these aircraft - retired aircraft have already been sold. And by May, we will have completed disposal of all of our 730 - 767 aircraft and Embraer 190 aircraft, generating more than $300 million in proceeds. Our fleet changes are expected to drive significant operational and cost savings in 2021 and beyond. With only 4 mainline aircraft types remaining, we will see improved aircraft utilization and operational efficiencies in the back half of 2021 through the increase in gauge and reduction in inactive aircraft, including spares and maintenance allocations. Additionally, our fleet harmonization project is picking up steam, and we expect to have our entire 737 fleet completed in the second quarter of this year. These aircraft have 172 seats and come with larger overhead bins and in-seat power. We expect to have the A321 fleet completed by the end of this year. Aside from a better customer experience, these projects will provide significant opportunities to improve revenue production and lower our unit cost now and well into the future. So when demand returns to more normalized levels, we'll be able to fly - efficiently fly 2019 levels of capacity with approximately 10% fewer aircraft. In terms of our balance sheet following our transactions in the first quarter, 32% of our outstanding debt is prepayable without penalty. After all the COVID-related financings we have completed to date, our average cost of debt is approximately 4.5%. As we have said in the past, we will naturally reduce our debt from where we are today by $8 billion to $10 billion over the next 5 years through regularly scheduled debt amortization. We know going forward that since we are now starting at a higher debt level on account of pandemic-related debt, we will need to de-lever even more. In the near term, we plan to maintain higher liquidity levels until we are generating sustained positive cash flow. Once this occurs, when combined with our efficiency measures and a lower CapEx profile, we plan to use any excess cash flow to more strategically de-lever our balance sheet by proactively retiring prepayable debt and concurrently increasing our unencumbered assets. As part of our plan, we also anticipate resetting our target minimum liquidity level. Overall, we expect second quarter total capacity to be down approximately 20% to 25% versus second quarter of 2019. With these capacity and demand assumptions, we expect to see a significant increase in our revenue versus the first quarter with our total revenue to be down approximately 40% versus the second quarter of 2019. These inputs lead to an estimated second quarter pretax margin, excluding net special items of between negative 27% and 30%. We presently expect to end the second quarter with approximately $19.5 billion in total available liquidity, which includes the additional PSP2 and PSP3 funds I mentioned earlier. That would be the highest liquidity position in company history and our fifth consecutive quarter of increased liquidity despite the demand-driven operating losses we have incurred over that period. Given these projected liquidity levels and the positive cash and demand trends, we are no longer looking to raise liquidity at American for the first time since the pandemic struck. For the full year 2021, our debt principal payments will be $2.8 billion, excluding the prepayment of our revolving credit facilities. In the second quarter, we expect to pay down $595 million of aircraft and engine debt in addition to the $250 million PDP facility we paid off earlier this month. Our full year CapEx is still expected to remain minimal. Non-aircraft CapEx will be $900 million. And due to our negotiated settlements with Boeing attractive aircraft financing and our already modernized fleet, our net aircraft CapEx, including PDPs, will be an inflow of $1 billion. While we feel great about how much we have accomplished, we recognize that we still have a long way to go to get our business back to normal. Our team has done an amazing job of bolstering our liquidity, conserving cash and driving efficiencies throughout the organization, and we are very well positioned for the future. And with that, I'll open up the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Doug, two questions for you on the loyalty program. I wanted to ask you a question I asked a few years ago at your Investor Day. Given how valuable the loyalty program has become and how lucrative the business of selling miles has become, do you need to reconsider what American Airlines is? Are you an airline or are you a marketing company?\nDoug Parker: Yes. We're an airline, Joe, and always will be. The managed program is a big part of that, which helps us to market the airline.\nJoseph DeNardi: So Doug, in 2019, your loyalty program generated roughly the same amount of EBITDA as Marriott did. My question is, did you know that? Does that surprise you? And lastly, why don't you allocate 40% of the time on these calls to the loyalty program since that's how much EBITDA it represents for you all?\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Joe. Yes, look, I don't think it's possible to separate the EBITDA - the AAdvantage program from the EBITDA and the airline. They're inextricably linked, and you can't have one without the other. So anyway, that's what I believe. So the - and therefore, we talk about running the airline, which what we do every day. And again, the AAdvantage program does indeed - is an incredibly important part of that. Our - because we do such a good job of running an airline, people want to have miles in our loyalty program. People want to have credit cards that allow them to earn miles as they spend to earn miles so they can fly more on our airline. Those are all good things. But you can't have one without the other, and I don't think it's right to try and separate one P&L from the other.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: I guess just maybe Robert or Doug. Robert, you talked about international lagging. You talked about calling out transatlantic, and yet we are seeing headlines over the last week or so about the potential opening of at least the U.S./U.K. corridor maybe as soon as the month of May, maybe June. Can you just give us an update on what you're hearing and whether or not we're going to see maybe unfettered access between the U.S. and U.K.?\nRobert Isom: So we're - Mike, we're certainly hopeful, and we encourage our government to engage with the U.K. But look, this is a matter - a bilateral matter, and it's one that first have to be predicated on confidence and safety of travel. So we're encouraged and we're certainly ready when the opportunity allows it. And we know, as I said, that there's tremendous demand, both from a corporate and from a leisure perspective, to take advantage, but we're going to have to make sure that we're coordinated with all parties, governments and government agencies to make sure that we're doing it in an appropriate manner.\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then just my second call, just to Vasu on JetBlue, American. I mean, I know it's early. Any sort of quick wins with respect to flow traffic between the two of you in JFK and Boston? And then the story - I mean, certainly a lot of criticism in - at least it seems in the press and from other entities out there, and yet it feels like the story that's not being told is just the number of new services. And I just think about the phase that was just launched in the last day or two, the number of markets that maybe didn't exist before that now exist like a JFK Cali, JFK Boise and then the number of city pairs where you're going from 1 to 2 or 2 to 3 or 3 to 4. For whatever reason, that story doesn't seem to be out there because I sort of view that as being enhancing competition, not taking away from it. So any sort of update that you can give on - with respect to that alliance?\nVasu Raja: Yes. Mike, thanks for the question. It's a great question. And look, [Indiscernible] start the story about that because you're absolutely right. AA and JetBlue together, the fastest-growing airlines in the whole Northeast corridor. Not just adding new services that certainly AA would have never thought possible to JFK daily, but arguably in which JetBlue wouldn't have thought possible, such as Boston and Cincinnati. And there's a lot of things, but really - so the first part of your question, it's all been enabled, really the customers are the true voice of this because if they like it, they'll fly on it. And we've seen that so far. So March was our first month in which we turned on the codeshare. We only had about 3 weeks' worth of bookings. And at least for JetBlue on AA, that was only about 25 to 30 markets. But JetBlue has already become our largest global codeshare partner. That's a little bit weird because so many of our international partners are flying 5% to 10% of their schedule, but what we do draw some encouragement from is that our codeshare scope is vastly smaller with JetBlue than just about any of our major partners. And as we look at these things, we look at not just the total revenue production on us, but how much of that revenue is really incremental that is coming in higher fares than what we - what AA is organically booking or coming in periods where the flights were light. And we're finding that somewhere between 30% and 40% of that is incremental with similar rates in Alaska, and that compares extremely favorably to our historical global alliances. So that, for us, as much as anything, is an indication of exactly what you said, the customer is voting. And the customer really likes the new services, likes the service expansion that's there. And as long as that's the case, it's going to be attractive for us financially. And so we'll continue to grow and innovate and try things that would not have been possible without a partnership such as this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Can you just bridge us from the current international demand commentary of kind of 20% of normal or maybe that was a March comment, 20% of normal and then getting to 80% from a capacity perspective this summer?\nVasu Raja: Yes. This is Vasu. I can help with that. That - a big part, when we quote international, we're quoting both our long-haul business and our short-haul international business. Of note, the way we get to 80% is that we are envisioning a long-haul business, which will be, come our peak summer schedule in July, 40% of its 2019 size. But a short haul of international business, which will be north of that, something like 20% larger than what it was in 2019, with our long-haul Latin American network being something like 80% of 2019, right? So - but maybe even the more colorful way to say is that, for us, long-haul is going to be a very small part of our system this summer. Our total long-haul network, Transatlantic, Transpacific and long-haul Latin America will roughly - will be about 3% to 5% of the seat capacity of the airline from the peak July schedule. So a lot of what you see is, in our international numbers, is more capacity going into the short-haul network, which, for us, has proven to be the most resilient part of the whole system ever since the pandemic started. No matter what the headlines have been, no matter how the market turns, we've always tend to find bookings rebounding fastest soonest and greatest in those markets. And you see that in our RASM results, we\u2019re flying the biggest schedule in short haul, international and producing the greatest comparative RASMs out there, too.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then just a follow-up for Derek. On the net aircraft CapEx inflow of $1 billion, can you just tell us how much of that is sale leaseback proceeds? And how much of that is sort of PDP refunds?\nDerek Kerr: Yes. Our net aircraft CapEx is about $145 million, so direct sale leaseback of aircraft is about $2.7 million. So we have about $2.6 million of aircraft CapEx, and that's all financed by direct lease and sale leasebacks. And then the PDPs is about $850 million.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Sorry, just a small point of follow-up there. Can you give us a sense for where aircraft rent might be kind of exiting this year?\nDerek Kerr: Yes. Aircraft rent, we'll exit - we have about 350 in the first quarter, exit around 400 in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: So I have two questions. One is, you guys said that you flew more passengers than any other airline, and I know your cargo revenue was fairly strong as well. But I was looking at your revenue compared to the - just your absolute revenue, not your unit revenue, and it was lower than that of like Delta, and I'm kind of wondering what you think accounts for the difference. And then my follow-up question is related to - are you talking to the Biden administration about reopening borders, obviously, safely, but reopening borders this summer to gain at least some summer international traffic?\nDoug Parker: I'll take the second.\nDerek Kerr: Yes. I can just - I can try to take the first. Look, I can - I don't know the detail on Delta's number. I can tell you this, that it's not passenger revenue and it's not cargo revenues.\nDoug Parker: So what is it? [Indiscernible] Anyway, we know exactly what it is in there. They do have business we don't have. On the Biden Administration, absolutely, Helane. I mean as Mike had asked about U.K./U.S. corridor, we're heavily involved in that, given our relationship, given our - how large we are to the U.K. and our relationship with BA, of course. And we're in regular contact. The - look, what we support is a risk-based data-driven approach to restoring international travel. What we've seen is pre-departure testing for international [rail] (ph) has been in place early this year. CDC recently eased the guidance for domestic travel for vaccinated persons, following a lengthy study of that issue, so all these factors were taken into consideration. As formal guidance for travel is being developed, I think - I know the administration understands that. I know they understand the importance of international travel and restoring international travel to the economy. And we all need to go look at this in a risk-based way. No one wants to rush for certain, and no one's pushing that either. So anyway, I think it's going to happen gradually. We're going to do it in a way that works with our governments and works with other governments to ensure that it's done in a way where it's safe. No doubt, there's enormous pent-up demand for it. And we see that as some other countries have relaxed their restrictions on things like [Indiscernible]. So we'll keep working on it. Everyone who's involved are working productively. There's no sort of - there's certainly no sort of pushback on [our side] (ph). We all want to do this in a way that makes sense.\nDerek Kerr: Yes. And Helane, the biggest difference on the revenue side is the refinery, just so you know.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: So business travel, it's always been, obviously, a little bit more cyclical and riskier, but higher reward. Leisure travel tends to sort of endure and recover better. So you knew that. But as you drive out, whatever, $2 billion in cost, you densify your aircraft, is there a thought maybe that you don't want as much of that corporate share on the other side of this? And then maybe, obviously, I know business travel is important to you, I understand that. But maybe like an 80-20 leisure business mix makes more sense for American longer term, given your network footprint and the cost savings and the seat densification and all the other factors, just around the periphery, does that make sense?\nDoug Parker: No, we don't think so. And again, we think - actually, we're building a network that will serve business better [Indiscernible] network, and we're excited about that. So as soon as travel returns, we're building the airline to be there for them. And I think we'll be able to do that as well or better than anybody else.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thanks Doug. And then, Derek, can you help me think about the SWB line in '22, '23 as we contemplate juniority of the pilots and some of the headcount cuts on management, if we assume the capacity is at or maybe slightly above 2019 levels?\nDerek Kerr: From a salary perspective?\nHunter Keay: Yes, like an absolute SWB, not necessarily unit basis, but on just an absolute salaries basis relative to where you were pre-COVID with juniority and all that other stuff?\nDerek Kerr: Yes. I think we're going to have a significant amount of retirements as people went out. So when we talk about CASM in 2022 from a cost perspective on all of the groups, we should be down year-over-year from that perspective. So as we go out throughout the year, we're increasing just because from a salaries perspective, we have brought everybody back. So it will increase as we go through the second quarter, but then we should be pretty flat as we go into the third and fourth quarter as we have already brought everybody back for the flying that is for the rest of the year. So it should be - we should be in pretty good shape as we go forward with that. We all have contracts that are up, so it depends on when those negotiations happen. But on a steady-state basis, we'll be pretty flat throughout the rest of the year from a second all the way through the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: First one for Robert. So a question I frequently get is how quickly American can ramp up capacity in the event that an incremental market opens up. And in more stable times, it kind of felt like it was about 3 months between something happening, such as a spike in fuel and flown capacity actually reflecting that change. Where are we today? For example, if the EU announced today that vaccinated passengers are welcome, and I'm not suggesting this is going to happen, what months would we see that additional capacity?\nRobert Isom: So Jamie, I can start and others can chime in. First off, just in terms of market openings, just realize as well, we're dealing with booking curves, right? Much different than the domestic, where so much of the bookings occur within 30, 60 days. For some of these long-haul markets, even for business-related travel, the booking curve is much more extended. So even if markets were to reopen, so much of the actual window for purchasing for the summer has actually passed us by. So we're going to be smart about how we ramp capacity up so that we make sure that we can match a full demand profile with the aircraft. And that actually matches pretty well with the kind of timing that's required to get aircraft in position, pilots in position and cities that have actually been mothballed in so many parts of the world, back up and operating as well. So for us, to be able to actually be able to serve these markets, we're dealing with timelines that are in kind of the 3- to 6-month range. Vasu, you want to add anything to that?\nVasu Raja: The only thing I'll say is the very specific part of your question, look, in 45 days, we can go and out in the market and sell it and operate it in a way that we couldn't have done before the pandemic. But to Robert's very good point, that doesn't mean that we should or that we would because so much of it is - especially as markets reopen, is what's the best marginal use of the capacity that's out there. And just to add the dose of color to it is that even if so much of Europe opens up right now, the reality is we're, let's call it, 60% to 65% of the way through a historical booking curve for Europe, and a lot of the customers that would have gone there have already booked trips to Hawaii or Florida anyway. So the marginal value of that capacity may be a lot less than what might meet the eye, at least in the American.\nJamie Baker: Excellent. All good points. And then second question, and this is related to the second quarter guide. It feels somewhat reminiscent of last summer's strategy. And we talked back then about the low marginal cost capacity given PSP and where fuel prices were and why it made sense to fly more than your competitors, right? This year feels like a more calculated decision, less of a sort of grow or die decision to, I think, somewhat paraphrase what Vasu has said in the past. But the question I'm getting from investors is whether this summer's plan is markedly different than when you basically tried something very similar last year. Any thoughts on that?\nDoug Parker: Yes. I'll start, and Robert can chime in. Yes, it's dramatically different. And that - well, first off, last summer, what we saw was what looked to be a real drop in the pandemic rates. And as we saw that we started to add back when we got the second spike, demand fell off, and we adjusted accordingly. So all that was the right decision, it was based on that and nothing else. In this case, we have vaccines and the rates absolutely are falling. And as a result, you see not just us doing this, but virtually every other airline. So anyway, it feels - again, I don't exactly - I wouldn't concur exactly with what happened last July. Last July, we saw rates falling. It shows that capacity when they spiked back up, we pulled it back. Now we're seeing vaccinations resolved, something which feels much more permanent, should that not be the case, you'll see us pull back. We can be very flexible, and we will be. I don't think that will be the case. Nothing about this feels anything close to that, but that's the distinction.\nVasu Raja: And Jamie, I would just add one thing to that. Building off of Robert's comments in the section, that what you see out there in our schedule is actually really indicative of where the airline is going. 85% of our capacity this summer will be deployed in domestic, almost 95% of it is between domestic and short-haul international. And as you look at it for the last 3 quarters of the pandemic, though we\u2019ve flown relatively more capacity, we've also produced more in nominal PRASM than certainly what any of our network competitors have. But critically, when you look out there this summer, where the capacity is going is really important. But what we call the big 4, Dallas, Fort Worth, Charlotte, Phoenix, Miami, are roughly 65% to 70% of our system capacity. And I'll put a little more color on it. In the first quarter, while our system produced PRASM that was maybe 16% - 15% to 20% larger than what our network competitors were, Charlotte and DFW produced PRASMs that were 30% and 35% larger, with Phoenix and Miami pretty close to the 15% to 20% range, too. So a lot of what you see out there is actually - there's some opportunism in there about flying Saturday-only trips or leisure-heavy trips or things like that. A lot of it is - or as Robert said in his opening remarks, or getting the capacity of this network to market where we can produce outsized value to customers and therefore, outsized RASMs to the airline.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.\nDaniel McKenzie: A couple of questions here. Regarding the plan to prepay $8 billion to $10 billion in debt through natural amortization, does that include or exclude the plan to use surplus free cash flow to prepay debt? And the reason I'm asking is it just seems like American could pay down substantially more than $10 billion over the coming 5 years. And if that's correct, I'm just wondering if you'd be willing to provide sort of a bigger picture number of what that could ultimately look like.\nDerek Kerr: Yes. It does not include anything extra. That's just what we have in amortization going forward. We're not ready to say, but I agree with your premise, that our liquidity is sitting at $19.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We're going to go through the process of figuring out where we need our liquidity in the short-term and where we need it in the long term. And it's not - it doesn't need to be at $19.5 billion. But as we said, until we see sustainable cash production, we're going to hold the cash where we're at and keep our cash levels higher than we need. We will then use that to go do that. So as I said, we have a lot of prepayable debt. So once we're ready, we will go down that process and be able to de-lever more than the $8 billion to $10 billion. But I just wanted to make sure that, that $8 billion to $10 billion number, everybody knows, it's going to happen. It has to happen as we go forward and pay off the debt that's due, aircraft debt, unsecured, things that are going to come due over the next few years. But you're right, Dan. It's - it can be a bigger number, it's just we want to wait till we get through everything, and we're comfortable to move forward.\nDaniel McKenzie: Understood. Okay. Vasu, a fleet that is 10% smaller, so call it 10% less flying. I'm wondering if you can provide some insight on the overhang to margins, say, in 2019, with that portion of the fleet. And the reason I'm asking this question is just based on what American has done on the cost side, based on what you're doing on the revenue side, it just seems like normalized earnings in this next cycle are going to be higher than they were in the last cycle. And I'm just wondering if you guys would agree with that or what do we need to keep in mind?\nVasu Raja: Yes, some others can speak to what our earnings profile might look like, but you are on to something that we have made this airline materially more efficient through the pandemic year. This summer we'll be almost 150 airplanes down. But in the schedule, we'll only be about 80 or 85 airplanes down. So all of that delta is efficiency. It's inefficient airplane that went away, it\u2019s superior gauge economics, superior utilization, wherever we have it. So if you went to back half 2019, we could fly roughly that same airline with materially fewer jets, and the network would be oriented a lot more to places where we could produce an outsized RASM. So that is very much the conscious design. I mean the whole point to the earlier remarks about the Green Flag Plan is to deliver an airline that can outperform in the future, and we think we've done that, but the proof will be when we do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: I wonder if you could talk about how you're thinking about the cadence of capacity as you kind of move away from the summer and kind of - I know there's a lot of uncertainty. But right now, a lot of the demand is being driven by leisure. But should we expect this level of capacity or better as we move into the fourth quarter?\nRobert Isom: Savi, I'll just - look, we're going to be incredibly flexible as we go forward. I mean we've given a lot of detail as to what we intend to fly this summer. If things progress as we hope with vaccinations increasing and then hopefully international markets opening up, and based on what we're hearing from our corporate customers in coming back to work, back into the office and setting meetings and events, we're optimistic. But it really is dependent on the continued containment of COVID and people getting back to business.\nDoug Parker: To Jamie's question, we have enormous flexibility in this regard. The schedule we have built is designed for the current leisure-based travel, that's why we have a 777s flying in the United States. They're not made to do that, it's not going to be happening a year from now. So as international markets open up, that's where those aircraft can be deployed. And - but again, we're going to wait for the demand to come back before we deploy the aircraft there. But right now, I think the team is doing a really nice job deploying airplanes where the existing demand is.\nSavi Syth: Great. And then if I may just follow-up on - partly your response to Hunter's question, just how much of kind of the 2Q costs are related to kind of getting capacity back online versus actually the capacity can be produced in the quarter? I was just wondering, as that kind of - how much is in the number today that might wind down as you kind of increase capacity going ahead?\nRobert Isom: There's really not - I mean, we don't have a lot of costs built into the second quarter for - to get the capacity back up. Most of the aircraft have been ready to go. We will have higher costs, but the higher costs in the second quarter really due to volume-driven costs. So our maintenance costs will be up because our power by hour costs will be up and things like that. But there's no built-in cost to retrain. There's no big built-in cost to get the fleet back up because the fleet is ready to go. Our team has done an incredible job of maintaining those aircraft over the last year and having them ready. We didn't mothball any aircraft. We didn't put them in a desert. We don't have to bring them back and spend a lot of money on engine costs and anything like that. So there's not a lot, I would say, in the second quarter to build the airline back up other than [flying] (ph).\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Robert or Vasu, maybe could you help us understand the cadence of sort of leisure fares? What I'm trying to get at is where we are today in sort of 1Q on a sort of like-for-like distance-neutral basis, for fares versus kind of a pre-crisis level. And then how the fare environment is changing as we move into the summer months? Obviously, we're adding capacity, a bunch of demand coming in. I'm just trying to get a sense for how the revenue management systems are working in terms of setting fares that would be expecting to see in sort of 2Q, 3Q.\nRobert Isom: Okay, Vasu can help me with the real specifics. I'll just say this, though, to kick it off, which is being able to leverage yields is dependent on having base bookings. And from that perspective, as I said in my remarks, we're seeing not only bookings but real load factors that actually allow for some optimism about where pricing is going. So Vasu?\nVasu Raja: Yes, that's right, David. We have seen an inflection point with yield, which is, for us, any - the thing that we most draw in terms of encouragement. To put some context to it, when we came into the first quarter of this year, our selling fares were roughly half of what they were a year ago. For half of last year's price, you could gain access to the American Airline system. As we go out into the summer, there's something like 90% of where they were a year ago. And indeed, in our leisure markets, and by leisure to be really specific here, we count that as short-haul international and also all the obvious domestic markets, Vegas, Orlando, Florida, things like that, Our seat capacity there is up about 25%. But there our yields are about 95% to 100% - bookings are 95% to 100% of what we were taking a year ago. And so that, for us, as much as anything, is really key because we are in a place now, if you'll notice the commentary, we're not spending a lot of time talking about bookings because in our system, engineering bookings is not the issue anymore. So much of it is about getting yields back and getting RASMs back, especially in our domestic system. As big as we are historically in our network and the way we're shaping it the summer, domestic RASM is key to our success. And given what's happening with traffic, yield is super important. So we are doing all we can to go and yield up wherever we see it.\nDavid Vernon: So just to clarify, were you referring to 95% of 2020 levels or 2019 levels?\nVasu Raja: 2019 levels, sorry. All my comments is actually 2019. I apologize.\nDavid Vernon: Yes, that was slightly frightening. Just as maybe a follow-up, Derek. You mentioned before managing the airlines to a little bit lower level of leverage. How do you think about talking to your Board about the financial liability risk when you've got all these unencumbered assets? I think one of the things that maybe surprised a lot of us is that there were a lot of assets that you could tap into for debt and credit. How do you think about managing or measuring that or maybe communicating that to the market going forward so that we maybe have some visibility into additional liquidity that you could tap outside of like the traditional kind of debt-to-EBITDA metric just given the fungibility of the assets that are in the network, particularly if you buy down more aircraft with cash?\nDerek Kerr: Yes. I think, number one, we're not looking for more liquidity. So that's like - the good news now is I come in every day and not have to go look for liquidity. But we will keep everybody up-to-date on the unencumbered assets. And as we look forward and if we have excess cash, we're going to manage it properly to figure out what is the best thing to pay down as we move forward. So we are going to have conversations with the Board on liability management that we're going to discuss, what are we going to do over the next year or 2 years. That if we have excess cash, what do we pay off and what's the best things to unencumber as we move forward. In today's environment, our unencumbered assets are $3.7 billion. They grow every time we pay off aircraft and [EETCs] (ph). We have the first lien capacity of about $7 billion. So we have the ability to do more, but the good news is we're not looking to do more right now as we go forward. So I think the key is, as we move forward, what is the liquidity levels we need to be at, what are the ratios we want to be at as we move forward and how do we best do that over the time period with any excess cash that we have above the amount that we need. And so we'll be having those discussions over the next - every Board meeting, and we'll be discussing that with our Board for a period of time as we move forward through this recovery.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.\nMyles Walton: I was just wondering, to clarify on the no longer looking to raise liquidity. Would you also be comfortable saying that you have no interest at this point, accelerating the deleverage with additional equity? And then maybe if you can just give us a bit of color on the walk from $17.3 billion to $19.5 billion, and the PSP contribution in there. And if that's as simple as sort of $1 billion underlying cash burn offsetting the PSP?\nDoug Parker: I'll take the first one. And I think I can do the second one also, but Derek can do better. So we - anyway, on the first point, yes, when we say we're not looking to raise financing, we're not looking to raise financing and that includes equity. And as Derek said, we believe - we know that we have just through our normal amortization schedule $8 billion to $10 billion of debt going down over the next 5 years. And as was noted by Dan McKenzie, we have the ability to do a little bit more than that so long as the recovery continues on the path that it appears to because we'll end up with more cash than we needed. So that's how we would choose to de-lever over time. And then again, I'll try to be quick because I'm already talking, but Derek can probably do it better. The - if you - I think what you're asking is, if you have the PSP payments and you look at our cash, you actually see that it's net, not up as much as the PSP. The reason for that is seasonality of - first off, the seasonality of sales is not as strong in the second quarter as the first. And we also - and the debt payments are larger in the second than the first. But even if you excluding debt payments, we're still cash positive in the second quarter, excluding debt payments on that forecast.\nDerek Kerr: Debt and interest.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Derek. So that's what is seasonality. I will use this to go on my little soap box because - this is why, by the way, we - there are GAAP principles. It's because cash flow has a lot of seasonality. So we're going to be - there was a real reason at some point when we were talking about cash burn, cash burn, cash burn because the market had real interest in where people's cash flows were and how much cash they were burning. We're all well past that. And if we keep talking about cash burn, we're going to keep [computing] (ph) people because there's huge seasonality in cash in airlines. There's huge seasonality in debt payments. And when we were - when all of us were making large profits, we still had quarters where we had decline in cash. So that's why you go back to GAAP principles, and include things like accruals and smoothing and matching principles so that you can keep yourself actually know what's going on in the airline. So anyway, that's the soap box. I'm glad we're going to stop talking about cash burn and get back to talking about earnings. But anyway, that's the reason, but thanks for asking.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent with Citi.\nStephen Trent: I was just curious what you guys are seeing, if you could give a little more color. I think you mentioned that you're going to hire some pilots later this year. Any color with respect to what this could mean from a headcount perspective? And is American planning to apply any ESG-type filters on the hiring as some of your competitors have telegraphed that you want to diversify their base?\nRobert Isom: So yes, look, it's great news that we're looking at hiring pilots later this year. And it's due to a number of factors, most notably that we've had significant retirements over the past few years. So this is going to put us in a position to fly and be flexible where we need to be. From bringing pilots on though, we're incredibly excited about the work that we've been doing, both at the mainline airline and within our regional airlines as well. We also have been marching down the path to ensure that those that are coming into our regional airlines are wholly-owned and also our mainline really represent the face of the country. Most notably, ensuring that we have more women and people of color that are taking the ranks of - the pilot ranks. And so you'll see that we have a [cadet] (ph) program that now has over 350 people in it. That's just going to grow in the future. And as we look forward, we anticipate getting a substantial number of our total pilots brought in through that program. So very excited about where we're headed.\nDoug Parker: And that program is diverse.\nRobert Isom: And that program is, by and large, designed to bring in, again, people of color and females into the pilot ranks.\nDoug Parker: Females and people of color.\nOperator: This completes our analyst portion of the Q&A. We will now move to media questions. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Yes. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the latest issue with the 737 MAX and whether that creates any challenges for you all in kind of rebuilding confidence in the plane that something else has come off after all the vetting that happened fails to find the latest problem?\nRobert Isom: Aly, it's Robert. Look, I am really pleased with Boeing and the industry. We coalesce around safety. And so with the MAX and - with any aircraft, it's critically important that we take the right steps when there's any potential concerns. And in the case of the 737 MAX and these, at least for us, these 18 aircraft, we have a pretty good idea of exactly what the issue is and the remedies that need to be attended to. So the work that we're doing is with both Boeing and the FAA. We're waiting on a service [Indiscernible] to be developed, air worthiness directors to be dropped and then getting the work done in those aircraft back up in the air. We hope that, that's just in a matter of weeks and not longer. In terms of the impact on our schedule, look, we've been flying the MAX now for 4 months back and incredibly successfully. Passenger reaction has been really that they like the product. They like the aircraft. And as we take a look going forward, even with 18 aircraft out of service right now, there is virtually no impact to our schedule. We've been able to use other aircraft to fund the needs for the airline. So overall, I think we've - as an industry with Boeing and certainly with the FAA, we've made all the right moves, and I have great confidence that this aircraft is going to be in the skies and the safest and most reliable for years to come.\nAlison Sider: Thanks. I mean have you seen any increase in book away on the MAXs that are still flying? Like is there any sign that customers have any elevated concerns?\nRobert Isom: Not at all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs with CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: You mentioned that bookings were ticking up. Of course, looks like a much stronger summer than last year. What are your projections for after summer vacation season starts to wane? Do you expect a lot of that leisure demand to go away? And do you think there's going to be enough business demand to replace it?\nVasu Raja: Leslie, this is Vasu. Thanks for the question. Look, it remains to be seen. Throughout the pandemic, it's always difficult to forecast or prognosticate that far out. Those things are recovering, that difficulty remains. So it remains to be seen, as Robert and Doug mentioned earlier. Though, for us, the real lever is our capacity. And if things change, we can change with it. Over the last year, we have any number of tools and techniques to go and make the airline pretty nimble and responding to it. So first things first is to manage the summer and then we'll treat fall as it gets closer.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. And then the bookings that you have so far, are you seeing that they drop off after August or July? Or is there any one point where you see kind of a slowdown?\nVasu Raja: We're seeing pretty consistent bookings growth throughout periods. Indeed, where bookings are falling is a conscious decision on the part of the airline so that we don't do things like, for example, sell-out Thanksgiving week too soon. But we see continued strong bookings as we go out there. We just want to make sure they're coming in at fares to make the airline stable.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: I want to ask first real quick, if I can go back to Alison's question on the MAX, I wanted to see if you have any information or can you comment on if there's the frustration level on the fact that you haven't yet gotten a service bulletin on that repair, which originally, the talk was that those repairs would be fairly simple and straightforward. But now it's been weeks and you don't have anything yet from Boeing?\nDoug Parker: Not at all. That's the FAA's job, and they do it well, and we work really well with them. And as Robert said, we all coalesce around safety, that's part of the process, but at least [not frustrated] (ph).\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. And if I can also ask, Vasu, if you could talk a little bit about the wide-bodies domestically and what plane you're flying where domestically?\nVasu Raja: Yes. Mary, I can talk a little bit about it. But really, the bigger story on the wide-body is just how - frankly how dynamic the airline has gotten in managing capacity around the system, which is frankly easy to do in the world of scheduling. It's a lot harder to actually deliver it for our customers and do so reliably in a way that they like. And so through the pandemic because international demand is falling, sometimes even as opposed to 45 or 60 days from departure, we've been taking out international flights. But as we've seen strong bookings in, say, Miami or what have you, we've been putting those wide-bodies in there. So a big part of it is very dynamic, and it changes a lot. What we're most encouraged about is wherever we've seen them, indeed, we've been able to deliver it on short notice and per our earlier comments in a way our customers like. Our customer satisfaction scores have indeed never been higher. The only real method beyond that to where the wide-bodies go this summer if they are concentrated disproportionately and what we call hub-to-hub markets, those are markets like Miami, DFW and also our big Sun Belt market, especially in Miami. So we're now in a place where Miami to New York is all on wide-bodies, Miami to Los Angeles on wide-bodies, Miami to Boston largely on wide-bodies, too. So we don't anticipate very many material changes versus what you see on the schedule. But if things change in international, that's a real lever for us. The marginal capacity of that is probably better spent to domestic right now than what it is in most of long-haul.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Koenig with The Associated Press.\nDavid Koenig: I guess this is for Vasu. I wanted to follow-up on what you were saying to David Vernon on fares. The 90% - as you approach this summer, the 90% of 2019 levels, is that due in any part to more business travel? Or is it pretty much just that you can get higher fares from leisure travelers? And then to follow up on that, is that pretty much leisure fares across your system, domestic and short-haul international?\nVasu Raja: Thanks for the question. And look, to be clear, that 90% or the book yields we're taking right now, there could be any number of factors that impact what they actually come in at once the summer is all said and done. But yes, it is primarily driven by leisure demand growth. We are seeing signs of business growth, but it's coming off of a small base, and it's still a pretty small part of our system total. So most of the yield growth we're seeing is from the leisure travel segment. And frankly, a lot of what yield growth is there is just because we're seeing a lot of cases where, especially on peak holidays and things like that, where, frankly, the demand for seats is greater than supply of seats, and so that's what produces higher yields.\nDavid Koenig: And that's pretty much system-wide?\nVasu Raja: No, it's not. Our system is really uneven. It's much more heavily concentrated among our domestic leisure and short-haul international markets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today.\nDawn Gilbertson: I wanted to ask a question for you, Vasu. The State Department earlier this week raised the travel alerts to their highest level for most countries. I'm wondering if you have seen or expect to see any impact on bookings? And if not, why not?\nVasu Raja: Dawn, it's good to hear from you. I'll start and others can add. But if you look at the range to be seen in the last, whatever, it's been 48 hours, maybe 96 hours since it's happened, it's been too early to tell what's going on and what its impact to bookings might be. If indeed, there is one, we have ample tools to be able to adjust the airline should it come to pass. But then also the last thing I'll add to it is, from my earlier comments, the way we've configured the airline this summer is very much to make it resilient to just these kinds of changes where 85% of our capacity is in the domestic system, in large part because we realize that the recovery is not just going to be choppy from a demand perspective, but choppy from a market opening perspective as well. And so by building the plan like that is something that we could deliver upon for our team and our customers and create a lot more resilience as the world recovers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News.\nKyle Arnold: I know you have some plans and you announced the plans to start hiring some pilots. Do you guys have any - will there be any need going to the year for other employee groups, flight attendants or groundworkers or gate agents?\nRobert Isom: The answer to that is, yes. And you'll see that throughout our network, and it's especially from a passenger service, a team member or those folks that work on the fleet side of things, we're going to have needs throughout the network, but it's really just based on location needs more than anything else. And too soon to say anything about where we stand with our flight attendants, but I can tell you that I anticipate that there will be a need there as well.\nDoug Parker: Yes. The flight attendants - we have so many of our flight attendants on - this opportunity to take leaves and that what we're doing rather than hiring new flight attendants is bringing flight attendants back from leave earlier than their leave would have extended. So having them come back off of leaves than they would have otherwise. Once we get through that, we'll need to hire, but we're not there yet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Russell with Skift.\nEdward Russell: Robert, could you tell me a bit more about how many aircraft American needs to reactivate to fly all of its fleet this summer? And what types are still needing to be reactivated?\nRobert Isom: No, we have aircraft that are ready to go. Of course, we had - we're - as Derek mentioned in his comments, we're accelerating our reconfiguration program, our harmonization programs on the 737 and A321. So we'll have some aircraft that are caught up in that. But the way to look at our fleet is that they're all out there and maybe not utilized as much as they will be, but we feel great about the work that our maintenance team has done to keep everything ready to file when necessary.\nEdward Russell: So just a follow-up, you don't have any aircraft temporarily stored anymore at this point? Is that the way to characterize it?\nRobert Isom: Correct. Yes.\nOperator: And at this time, I would now like to turn the conference back to Doug Parker for closing remarks.\nDoug Parker: Fantastic.

Joining us on the call this morning, we have Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call for the Q&A session are several of our senior executives, including Maya Leibman, Steve Johnson, Vasu Raja, Alison Taylor, and David Seymour. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and the actions we've taken during this pandemic. Robert will then follow with some remarks about our commercial and other strategic initiatives. After Robert's remarks, Derek will follow up \u2013 follow with the details on the quarter and our operating plans going forward. After Derek's comments, we will open the call for analyst questions and lastly, questions from the media. Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast of capacity, fleet plans and liquidity. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release filed with an 8-K this morning, as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP result is included in the earnings press release, and that can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on the website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So, thanks again for joining us. And at this point, I\u2019ll hand the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Dan, and thanks everybody for being with us. So, look, before I begin my prepared remarks, I want to preemptively state that we will not be commenting nor answering questions on the recent activity in our stock price. As a rule, we don't speculate on a day-to-day moments in our share price. We stick to that rule today. So we do a lot \u2013 we do want to talk about. So I\u2019ll just start and then Robert and Derek will add some more and we will take questions after that as we always do. So, look, 2020 was obviously an incredibly difficult year, but we couldn't be prouder of what the American Airlines team accomplished in the face of extraordinary challenge. Our team kept the country and economy moving and they did so safely with great care. American Airlines flew more customers last year than any other airlines. And our team did so while running a solid operation, ensuring our aircraft and airport facilities were clean and safe for every customer who needed us. We ended on a high note with the extension of the Payroll Support Program. This positive outcome is the result of the company and union leadership working arm-in-arm, bring PSP2 over the finish line. It's clearly great things come about when we raise our voices together for the greater good. Of course also grateful to our elected officials who recognize that the airline industry plays a vital role in the recovery from the pandemic. We talk a lot about the best days here in American. We use that term to describe moments that make American truly unique and why our team believes it's the best airline in the world. December 24 was that best day for me. We welcome back all of our fellow team members and reinstated their paying benefits. Thanks to our tremendous support teams working around the clock, we were able to deliver thousands of colleagues their first paycheck in months. [Indiscernible] a lot happened in 2020 on top of navigating the pandemic. Yes, we took aggressive steps to permanently lower our costs, increase our liquidity and care for customers in ways we've never seen before due to COVID-19. But we also accomplished significant milestones like entering into groundbreaking new partnerships and reaching a new joint collective bargaining agreement covering our fleet and maintenance columns. And just last month, we seamlessly returned the Boeing 737 Max to commercial service. We'll talk more about the accomplishments shortly. As we sit here today, I can unequivocally state that despite every challenge thrown our way, I've never been prouder of a company in my entire career. The American Airlines team and our industry is incredibly resilient and this past year has proven that. As we turn our attention to the year ahead, 2021 will be a year of recovery. There's still a lot of unknowns of course, when or how quickly demand will return. Make no mistake, it will return. The good news is there are vaccines. And while it will take some time for them to be widely distributed, progress is being made every day and that's encouraging. We don't know exactly when we may return to prior levels of demand. What we do know is that we're prepared to withstand the ongoing crisis, irrespective of how long the recovery takes. We ended the year with over $14 billion of total available liquidity. And more importantly, we've used this opportunity to make American much stronger. When the recovery does occur, we'll be prepared and even better position when we were prior to the pandemic, and we'll do so. I thank our team, our customers and our company. On the team front, we're proud of the progress we've made, especially in 2020. This crisis has brought the American team together, strengthened the relationship between management and our union partners in incredible ways. Since the onset of the pandemic, we've been meeting with our unions every two weeks to discuss the company's response to the crisis and our path forward. And we sit side by side, as you work to advocate for PSP to PSP2. It was a difficult decision to furlough 19,000 team members last fall, we prepared for that reality in a way that was cooperative and collaborative with our union partners. Our hope is to expand what we've accomplished in the past year, knowing that together we can be the best in the industry at advocating and caring for our team. For our customers, we're doubling down on operational excellence. Once we're back at full speed, we're positioned to run the best airline American Airlines has ever run in terms of operating reliability. We reset our network to focus even more on our strongest and best performing hubs and migrated to a much simpler more modern fleet. We talked before about efficient growth in Dallas, Fort Worth and Charlotte, and that work is now done. We continue to modernize our facilities at Washington Reagan and improve the connectivity of Chicago O\u2019Hare, Phoenix, Philadelphia and Miami. And we're building a much stronger network than we had before. In addition to the inherent strength of our hubs, in 2020 we established new and innovative partnerships with Alaska and JetBlue. It'll make us stronger on the West Coast and in the Northeast. We also noted a lot over the past year to make American a much more efficient airline. We had a truly unique opportunity to shut down the worst airline in the world and rebuild around our strengths. It's enabled us to bring forward and accelerate a number of efficiencies in 2020 that were originally planned for the longer term. And we are passionately pursuing those efficiencies as we recover through 2021. Derek will elaborate on this in his remarks, but two of the best examples are the permanent retirement of more than 150 aircraft in five different aircraft types, and a 30% reduction in our management staff. We believe the efficiencies we built in the business will drive more than $1.3 billion of permanent, non-volume related, non-fuel related savings in 2021, and of course, beyond. So in summary, we could not be more proud of the work the American Airlines team has accomplished over the past year. We're very well positioned and feel great about where American is going to be as demand returns. With that, I'll turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to also thank the entire team for their tremendous efforts in navigating the exceptionally challenging year. Supporting our team members and customers was paramount in 2020, and it continues to be a priority as we move into 2021. We continue to expand our pre-flight COVID-19 testing to make travel easier, including pre-flight testing for certain international destinations and at-home testing for travel to all U.S. cities requiring negative tests. In the fourth quarter, we began to rollout on the digital health passport, VeriFLY, so customers can easily confirm testing and COVID-19 travel requirements and streamline airport check-in. This tool is now available for travel to many international locations and for travel in the United States. Starting today, customers also will have the ability to use VeriFLY for travel to the U.S. to the UK and Canada, as we will continue expanding our use of VeriFLY this year to open up new \u2013 to open up international travel in key markets. With cleanliness and safety top of mind, last month we were pleased to achieve STAR certification from the Global Biorisk Advisory Council for our entire fleet of aircraft and for our Admirals Club lounges. This is a testament to the effect of cleaning, disinfection and infectious disease protocols we put in place over the past year. As customers return to skies, we've taken a number of steps to give them flexibility and competence when they book with American. We have eliminated change fees on both domestic and international itinerary, and fees from mileage reinstatement on canceled award bookings, domestics same day travel standby, standby travel, and reservations booked by phone. We also made it easier for top-tier customer to earn advantage elite status. Paused mileage expiration through June 30, 2021 extended 2020 status into 2022 for all members. Each of these efforts is predicated on our philosophy that American Airlines should be the easiest airlines to do business with. And we'll continue delivering on that commitment as more people return to flying. Our fourth quarter revenue was down considerably versus 2019, 64% year-over-year. But we saw improvements compared to the third quarter when revenue was down 73% year-over-year. The momentum we saw heading into the fourth quarter was tempered by the surge in COVID-19 cases and the increased travel restrictions in many parts of the country. As we have done throughout the pandemic, we responded by making closing adjustments to our schedule, while maximizing the connectivity of our network. In a testament to our team that our fourth quarter passenger unit revenues were by far the best in the industry. We will continue to be flexible and match our future capacity with observed booking trends while playing to the strengths of our hubs and the parts of the country where travel demand is greatest. And in here over two-year basis, we currently expect our first quarter system capacity to be down 45%. The recent CDC order to require a negative COVID test for entering into the U.S. has had an impact on our international bookings. So many countries and hospitality providers are planning to make testing available to travelers. The timing and scale of these efforts remain unclear. Given this continued demand volatility, we\u2019ll remain as flexible as possible and match capacity to demand. Our ongoing engagement with leisure operators will pay dividends as we head toward recovery. I want to acknowledge our sales team and an entire customer organization for their work. This team was recently named Airline Partner of the Year by the American Society of Travel Advisors and the Best Overall Airline for Students and Youth by StudentUniverse, which are both important accolades during such a challenging year. Cargo remains a bright spot for our business. Our cargo revenue in the fourth quarter was up 32% year-over-year. Despite flying a significantly reduced schedule, in 2020 American operated more than 5,200 cargo-only flights transporting 167 million pounds of critical goods and supplies around the world during the pandemic. Cargo will continue to be an area of focus in 2021. We remain optimistic about the recovery because of the changes that we've made to our network. We will offer customers the largest and most compelling global airline network thanks to the actions taken in 2020. We will have the full run rate benefit of our advocates in Dallas, Fort Worth and Charlotte, our best performing hubs, and we'll have a fantastic new facility at Reagan Nashville that will enable us to update the hub. By the third quarter of 2021 all of our DCA flights will have a first-class product, but we will eliminate the 50-seat regional jet operations there. Our pre-simplification, continued, updated and improved conductivity will also scale the cost of our other connecting hubs that improve their revenue generating capabilities as well. Our new partnerships with Alaska and JetBlue will also create the best and largest network for our customers on the West Coast and in the Northeast. Customers will have access to a seamless network that allows us to focus our efforts on what we do best. In New York, we will remove the 50 seat regional jet, upgrade our service and offer a much more competitive network for customers. As a result, we will launch new long-haul international flights from New York this summer. We will start service to Tel Aviv and Athens. Similarly, we are working with Alaska on the West Coast. In this year when demand returns, we will begin service from Seattle to London, Chennai and Bangalore. We have also announced a new integrated frequent flyer offering and have signed new corporate contracts. This partnership is already creating value for customers throughout the West Coast, including our hub in Los Angeles. Lastly, while we anticipate international demand will be slower to recover, we will use our strength in Latin America and our partnerships to create a leading international network. Our Latin American network has long value, deeply valued by our customers and its performance during the pandemic has been stand-out. Despite near-term demand volatility, we expect Latin America to recover sooner than the rest of our international network and we will continue to offer customers the largest and most comprehensive network in the region. We rationalized many parts of our transatlantic and transpacific networks during the pandemic, reintegrating more deeply with our partners. As an example, with our partnership with Qatar Airways, we've been able to leverage Doha as a global connecting hub, which has opened up many new markets for our customers. If demand recovers, we anticipate leveraging these partnerships to start flights and increase global connectivity even more. We believe the structural changes we made in 2020 will enable us to produce industry-leading revenues and lower expenses, through our focused customer proposition, broader network in a smaller fleet. We will continue to adapt our business to customers need and we'll keep working hard to make sure that they have peace of mind when they travel. And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Robert and good morning everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I would also like to thank our entire team for their tenacity and resilience throughout the pandemic. While 2020 was a certainly a financial difficult year for the airline, the collaboration, teamwork and sheer grit our team demonstrated was impressive. This morning, we reported a fourth quarter GAAP net loss of $2.18 billion or $3.81 per share. Excluding $32 million of net special non-operating items we reported a net loss of $2.21 billion or $3.86 per share. For the full year 2020 we reported a GAAP net loss of $8.9 billion and excluding net special items we reported a net loss of $9.5 billion. Robert talked about what we're seeing with the revenues, so I'll focus my remarks on the cost side of the P&L. Through aggressive actions, we have reduced our fourth quarter total operating expense including net special items by 37% versus 2019. We remained focused on aligning our cost with capacity, while preserving the maximum amount of flexibility to respond to customer demand. We have accelerated several of our long-term efficiency plans and as Doug mentioned, we are on track to permanently remove at least $1.3 billion from our cost structure in 2021 MBR. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $14.3 billion of total available liquidity. Costs were flat from the third quarter to the fourth, and we continue to see a positive trend in our daily cash burn weight rate, which improved from approximately 44 million per day in the third quarter to approximately 30 million per day in the fourth quarter. The reduction was due to revenue improvements on higher capacity. As a reminder, our definition of cash burn includes 8 million per day of regular debt, principal, and cash severance payments. During the quarter, our treasury team did a phenomenal job of continuing to strengthen our liquidity through a series of capital market transactions. We raised approximately $1.5 billion of incremental cash through two equity transactions to strengthen our balance sheet composition. And we still have $118 million left on our previously announced after market equity authorization. I would like to take this opportunity to specifically thank our recently retired Treasurer, Tom Weir. Tom has been an invaluable member of our team for more than 20 years, his expertise will be missed but I am confident our new Treasurer, Meghan Montana and her team will pick up right where Tom left off. During the quarter, we took delivery of 10 MAX \u2013 737 MAX aircraft and we expect to take another seven in this quarter. These aircraft were built while the MAX was grounded and were efficiently financed through sale-leaseback transactions. Also, as a reminder, we reached an agreement with Boeing to secure deferral rights on eight of our 2021 MAX deliveries and all 10 of our MAX deliveries in 2022. We have deferred five of these aircraft to-date and as I mentioned in last quarter to avoid exercising additional deferral rights, we would need to see substantial improvement in the demand environment. As Doug discussed in his opening remarks, as we look ahead to a recovery in 2021, we are passionately pursuing the initiatives we have put in place to make the airline more efficient when we are back to a normalized demand and capacity environment. Like all airlines, our planning begins with our fleet. As we have mentioned on previous earnings calls, we have worked hard to rebuild our fleet into one that is simpler and much more efficient to operate, while offering our customers a consistent and improved product and experience. As part of that process, we have retired more than 150 older non-core aircraft including five total fleet types, lowering our average fleet age to 11.2 years, the lowest of the U.S. network carriers. Not surprisingly, the aircraft that we exited were the least cost efficient aircraft in our fleet. With only four mainline aircraft types remaining, we will see improved aircraft utilization and operational efficiencies in the back half of 2021 through the increased engage, reduction in inactive aircraft, including spares and maintenance allocations. Additionally, we have further accelerated our seat harmonization project and now expect the entire project to be complete by the end of 2021. When this work is done, we will have a more consistent product with more premium seats, larger overhead bins and in-seat power. These projects will provide significant opportunities that not only improve revenue production, but also lower our unit cost now and well into the future. As a result when demand conditions improve, we could eventually reach 2019 levels of capacity with approximately 10% fewer aircraft. We will also have a more efficient workforce on the other side of the pandemic. We reduced our management size by one-third, resulting in an estimated $500 million of permanent cost reductions. For reference that would drive more than entire pretax margin point on our total revenue base for 2019. Beyond that, we have implemented $700 billion in additional labor efficiencies that have been incorporated into our plans going-forward. These includes, but not limited to optimized staffing plans and the utilization of technology to be more efficient across our operation. For many of our work groups, these initiatives will allow us to achieve the best productivity levels that we have seen in years. Many of these projects would have come to fruition over time, but due to the extraordinary circumstances in 2020 we took the opportunity to accelerate and implement these efficiencies as part of our future foundation. As we looked in the first quarter, there continues to be a tremendous amount of uncertainty with bookings. Stubbornly high COVID-19 cases and more stringent travel restrictions continue to constrain demand. And as a result, we expect the first quarter demand environment to be very much like the fourth. As Robert noted, we expect capacity to be down 45%. We also expect total revenue to be down approximately 60% to 65% versus the first quarter of 2019 similar to our fourth quarter results. When this flat revenue performance is combined with known cost pressures from higher fuel, restoring pay to our furloughed workers and volume driven expenses, we expect our first quarter pretax earnings excluding special items to be lower than the fourth quarter. We presently expect to end the quarter with approximately $15 billion in total available liquidity. This results in an average \u2013 first quarter average daily cash burn rate of approximately $30 million per day flat with the fourth quarter. The first quarter also includes approximately $9 million per day of debt principal and cash severance payments which includes $360 million EETC amortization, including the maturity of our 2011 dash one EETC, which unencumbered 30 aircraft. Also included in our daily cash burn for the quarter is a $240 million contribution to our pension and $225 million in non-aircraft CapEx. In terms of our balance sheet, we feel good about the flexibility in efficiency we have. Approximately 40% of our outstanding debt is pre-payable without penalty and we still do not have any large non-aircraft debt maturities until our $750 million unsecured bond matures in June 2022. After all the COVID related financings we completed in 2020, our average cost of debt is just over 4%. For guidance for the full year of 2021, our debt payments will be $2.9 billion. And our pension payment is $695 million. Full year CapEx will be $900 million of non-aircraft CapEx and due to our negotiated settlements with Boeing discussed earlier and attractive aircraft financing, our net aircraft CapEx including PDPs will be an inflow of $1.2 billion. As we have previously stated when demand recovers we expect to use all excess cash to further de-lever our balance sheet. Earlier this month, we received the first installment of approximately $3.1 billion of PSP2 funds from the treasury department and negotiated an extension on the final draw date of the CARES Act loan facility from March 26 to May 28, 2021. This extension gives us more time to decide our liquidity needs for the year based on the pace of the recovery, as well as to evaluate alternatives to drawing the CARES Act loan. Our industry still has a long path to recovery ahead, but the actions we have taken in American to conserve cash both through liquidity and drive permanent efficiencies across the business give us confident that we are well positioned for the year ahead in the long-term. And with that, I'll open it up to questions from the analysts.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. You may begin.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning, guys. I\u2019m wondering if you could help us frame what the cost actions you guys have taken and the efficiencies that you guys pull forward through this crisis. Frame how that \u2013 how we should be thinking about EBITDA margins in your perspective from a 2023 or maybe a 2024 level? If you think about the $1.3 billion of non-operating cost takeout, plus the efficiencies in the fleet, if we get the revenue levels that we saw in 2019, where should we be thinking the EBITDA margins will shake out at that point?\nDoug Parker: Hey, Dave, it\u2019s Doug. Really hard, of course, to project what the 2023 margins are going to be without knowing how the demand is going to be. So again, when I think for best answer as I tell you, the $1.3 billion, as we described is real sustainable. I think what we when other ways taken that is if we were starting 2019 right now with this fleet, with lane of organization, this management, we have a management team, our earnings in 2019 would have been $1.3 billion of that \u2013 consistent and other things to happen, we\u2019ve added. We had a contract with our \u2013 so begin out with \u2013 those adjustments. But it\u2019s real \u2013 and it\u2019s fundamental difference in the airline right now. So you can use that to make your own 2023 projections.\nDavid Vernon: I realize it\u2019s difficult and nobody knows what demand is. I guess in our conversations with investors, it feels like people are framing your earnings power off of the 2019 base. When it sounds like with the fleet changes you\u2019re making and with the cost reduction that you\u2019re taking, that\u2019s too low of a starting point. And I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand if that is the right way to think about it, or if you think that the earnings power of the businesses is going to be materially higher or higher than it was, again, assuming the revenue environment stays\u2026\nDoug Parker: Right. So again \u2013 yes, Dave, we can appreciate the question. It\u2019s really hard to figure out the margin because it\u2019s so dependent on revenues. But to answer your question, to the extent people are modeling 2023 with whatever revenue assumptions they want to do, if you weren\u2019t \u2013 if you didn\u2019t know that American Airlines is going to be $1.3 billion more efficient, you should go with your numbers. If you have already suspected that, you don\u2019t have an adjustment to make. That\u2019s where we are. Those are the real differences in the way this company is now structured versus where it was in 2019.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thank you for the time.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James. You may begin.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just if I might on the cost side of things, can you provide any color on like 1Q 2021, what you\u2019re expecting on the OpEx side, including what might be temporary because of PSP2? And just a follow-up on, Doug, your comments, the response to David, I think are you basically saying the 2019 capacity, we should see $1.3 billion less and kind of non-fuel OpEx out of the system. Is that a fair way to look at it?\nDoug Parker: Yes.\nRobert Isom: Yes. And Savi, the answer \u2013 I mean, the one number that we do know is the number added back to salaries is about $300 million, which is the amount of money that we will have higher salaries due to PSP2 coming back. The other is volume. I think fuel price is definitely up, fuel price, and we gave you a 45% capacity. So I think if you calculate where the price of fuel is now, and that capacity increase, that fuel should be up right around $300 million where the curve is today. And then we have a little bit higher regional expenses because we\u2019re growing the regional little bit by about $100 million. So those are the key \u2013 the three key things. The rest is just depending on volume of growth that we have over the fourth quarter.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s helpful. All right. Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. You may begin.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Hey, two here. I guess Robert and Doug, Robert, you sort of alluded to the fact that the new testing requirement that went into effect, I guess earlier this week, it was obviously having some impact on maybe bookings to/from Latin America, Caribbean, et cetera? What\u2019s thoughts on \u2013 I know that the administration this week floated the possibility of domestic testing. And I just logistically \u2013 I just \u2013 I can\u2019t get my arms around that and I\u2019m not even sure if the airports would be able to facilitate it. Maybe it\u2019s an at-home type product. And it sounds like maybe you are gearing up for that, given what you\u2019re doing, sort of behind the scenes. Can you just talk about that and whether or not that would even be feasible?\nDoug Parker: Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Doug. Yes, we\u2019ve certainly haven\u2019t been informed that something that\u2019s evidenced. And what we know is what Robert said about the international testing is that we\u2019re getting that to work. And Robert said it\u2019s had an impact on demand serving on short-haul international flying, but we\u2019re supportive of that in anyway. Domestic testing as reasons you\u2019ve stated, I mean, it seems like something that would both be difficult and would have us testing Americans on airplanes that we all know are safe to be on. We\u2019ll obviously work with the administration and what they think makes sense and do our best to make sure the world doing everything we can to make sure that people are safe, and also that we get through this pandemic as quickly as possible, which is our best interest, but also let them know what kind of impact that would have on travel. But again, the bigger point is we haven\u2019t \u2013 what you say has been floated has been informed to us. And so we haven\u2019t heard anything directly from regulators or others about that possibility.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. Very good. And then just a quick one to Derek, you gave us the gross, or you gave us the pension contribution for the year, I think you said $695 million. How does that compare to what you anticipate expensing on the P&L? Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDerek Kerr: So the expensing on the P&L is actually a credit. I think it\u2019s \u2013 but let me get you back on that number. Make sure we\u2019ve got it right.\nMike Linenberg: Not a problem. Thanks, everyone.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O\u2019Brien from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. So my first one is on the $1.3 billion of the cost cuts. I guess, could you just walk us through what some of the larger buckets are there? It sounds like fleet simplification, management team are decent \u2013 management cuts are decent percentage of that. I know you gave the $500 million for the management headcount reduction. And then you touched on this a bit in your prepared remarks, but can you help us think about what proportion of that was \u2013 event it was pulling forward initiatives already laid out versus maybe potentially some new opportunities that came from turning over additional stones as a result of COVID?\nDerek Kerr: Yes. I would say, I mean, the two big buckets, as I talked about are the $500 million in management and then the $700 million in other labor, and that goes through all groups. So, it goes \u2013 it say, as you get the summary \u2013 it\u2019s through every group pilots, flight attendants, maintenance, fleet service. So as we look at every group we looked and see how can we be as efficient as we can in each one of these as we brought the people back. So there\u2019s no \u2013 the biggest item definitely is management and that\u2019s the $500 million and the $700 million goes in other things. We have a bunch of other items that are in that. There\u2019s facilities consolidations, fuel efficiencies, benefits, a lot of other items that we have gone through to make sure that we\u2019re as efficient as possible. We do have other savings that are out there that due to volume will be down, but we\u2019ll have to see if those are permanent over time and whether they come back. So I would say, we did take advantage of this, do some of this earlier. All of it was on our plans over the next probably three years, but we brought all of that forward. And as we went through the process of unfortunately having to furlough people and as we bring people back, how do we be as efficient as possible and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Dynamic manning at the airports, single agent boarding at airports, all of that stuff has been accelerated through this process and will be put in place as we grow back.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Got it. Understood. And actually maybe one more for you, Derek. Can you just walk us through the calculus in determining how much cash you want to get on your balance sheet for the coming months, just given the uncertainty? Is there a new minimum you want to have until demand gets back to a certain point and you just kind of factor in your expectations on cash burn to help decide on potential incremental raises? Or is it really just more opportunistic, either use equity to pay down debt in the future or keeping a pulse on the market, see if there are opportunities to raise both expense and debt\u2026\nDerek Kerr: Yes.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Yes, thanks.\nDerek Kerr: Yes, I think \u2013 I mean, we don\u2019t have any requirements other than $750 million in 2022. And then we do have some payments, some term loans and stuff that come up in 2023. So right now we\u2019ve gotten ourselves at the end of this quarter. We will be at $15 billion, a significant amount above the $7 billion we had in the past. So I think the liquidity is there. But we have to keep our policy and we have to keep watching it, see where the recovery is. But we are going to be opportunistic. Our biggest \u2013 we talked about the government loan, which we have $7.5 billion against the frequent flyer program for that government loan, which we would have to pull by May of 28. The determination of what do we do there is one of our \u2013 one of the biggest things we\u2019re going to do in the next few months. But we\u2019re happy with the liquidity level where we\u2019re at. We\u2019re in a really strong position. We don\u2019t have a lot of CapEx coming forward in the next two years at all. As I talked about our actual net CapEx is positive this year, which will bring in cash flow for us. So our biggest thing to look at right now is the government loan, how do we refinance that. Actually, we haven\u2019t pulled it yet. So how do we \u2013 what do we do for using that collateral and how much liquidity do we raise in that transaction. But we\u2019re really comfortable where we\u2019re at. And we don\u2019t have a lot of commitments going forward from an aircraft standpoint or CapEx standpoint or debt standpoint in the next two years.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. You may begin.\nHunter Keay: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nDoug Parker: Hey, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: Hey. A couple for you, Derek, probably, what\u2019s the latest on the 787 delivery schedule for this year? And just can you just give us a rundown on what you\u2019re planning for aircraft deliveries this year and next? And how many of them you already are financing in place for?\nDerek Kerr: Yes. Yes. So we have right now we haven\u2019t changed the delivery schedule on 787 yet. We have 19 deliveries coming this year, all fully financed. And as of right now, they\u2019re coming, but we are talking with our partners on those aircraft. The MAX, we have eight more coming, seven will come this quarter, all fully financed. And we have 16 neos coming, all of those fully financed. So our actual net aircraft CapEx, when we just talk about CapEx it\u2019s actually a positive. So those aircraft coming in will be positive cash flow. Next year, we have 26 Airbus 321s coming in. No financing. We have backed our financing on those, but no permanent financing yet. So we\u2019re working on 2022. We won\u2019t take any aircraft that don\u2019t have financing going forward. So we\u2019re fully financed on all 2021 with really good financing and we still are looking at 2022 right now. And we will look \u2013 as we look at the Airbus planes next year in the 788s, we\u2019ll continue to look at those aircraft as we talk to manufacturers.\nHunter Keay: That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks, Derek. And then, just two sort of quick clean-up ones. Interest expense, can you help me out with that this year and next will be great, even 2023, if you want to take a stab at it? And then what is your blackout period? And thanks.\nDerek Kerr: This is number two. Blackout period ends today or tomorrow.\nHunter Keay: Okay.\nDerek Kerr: And I\u2019ll get back to you on the net interest expense numbers.\nHunter Keay: Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global. You may begin.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Question on corporate demand, the broad view is that it\u2019s permanently impaired. And I\u2019m just wondering if you can elaborate on the latest conversations with your corporate travel managers, what that path to recovery might look like? I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no airline planning for 50% permanent decline in the spin. And I\u2019m thinking Americans got some share shift here. But I\u2019m just wondering if you could just help us connect the dots on this part of the recovery story?\nVasu Raja: Yes. Hey, Dan, this is Vasu. I\u2019ll start into that. Look, the reality is that corporate travel demand is down, 5% to 10% of what its historical levels were. And though, we are very optimistic it will then return as vaccines are distributed, the timing, the speed, the rate of that is unfair at that. But also as important as that is the thing that I really never forget, I mentioned this a lot I\u2019ll do it again here is the power of the network business, right? For us it\u2019s the primary value we create. And we create more origin and destination markets for customers that creates more value for them and that results them \u2013 they\u2019re paying us more for that product. And indeed, what we see right now is that 50% of the revenue that we\u2019re drawing are from origin and destination markets, where really American Airlines has the best network or in some cases the only travel option. And indeed, the yields in those markets are 50% higher than in markets where our product is the most commoditized and a ton of different carriers can provide the O&D. So that\u2019s a huge degree of leverage in the business because, of course there\u2019s a big thing we have going for us is that we can move our capacity around. And so in a world where corporate travel is slowed to come back and we should expect that it is. What we really try to do is make the airline as limber as possible so that we can go and create as much connectivity where there is travel demand. And that something \u2013 in some cases that we are taking leisure \u2013 we\u2019re taking it in some cases, where our origin and destination network is uniquely advantaged versus other airlines and the yields that we see in those O&Ds are materially higher than what we can generate even from what the business travel is there and really commoditized.\nAlison Taylor: Yes. Thanks, Vasu. One thing really close to our corporate travel managers and their risk management team to get all the information they need to feel comfortable to get their travelers back on the road and how you think that most of guys doing that and building confidence in travel through information and communication. We also stayed very close to GBTA and the other large association who provide great communication to these travel managers. Little early to say, but as you saw some of the surveys coming out from GBTA, they did indicate the back end of 2021, the start of COVID travel. Thank you.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Thanks for the perspective. I guess just following up on that, I\u2019m wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on travel passport initiatives. What countries are you focusing on initially for adoption? And I appreciate, it\u2019s early. But, is there a read on what is going to take for these \u2013 for countries to get a little more comfortable with this idea, maybe COVID metrics or what might they want to see?\nAlison Taylor: Unless we\u2019re with our great partners, we don\u2019t do this alone. So working with the tourism body, or our hotel partners, we have been able to spend very quickly in 90 plus markets, testing and posts. We have our VeriFLY help format that provides all the documentations you\u2019re ready to travel. You bought the tickets, you can go. And actually as an example that on Tuesday with thousand plus truckloads coming back from [indiscernible] to the U.S., everyone checked in and boarded successfully and had their negative tests. So we\u2019ve been able to similar techniques through communication with our customers and being very proactive without notification and calling customers directly and working on the brand across every station led by Jose Freig, who has done a great job making sure that with our brand we\u2019re ready to help our customers.\nDan McKenzie: I see. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Alison.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. You may begin.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. Very thorough call. Most of my questions have been answered. But Derek, you disclosed that you\u2019re able to achieve 2019 capacity on 10% of your aircraft. Would you be able to express the capacity base that would be required to get you back to 2019 ex-fuel CASM? Apologies, if I missed that in your prepared remarks.\nDerek Kerr: Capacity base meaning air \u2013 number of aircraft?\nJamie Baker: No. ASMs. And if 2019 is even the correct base to be using, that\u2019s just sort of become the industry standard at the moment. How much capacity do you have to operate to get back to 2019?\nDerek Kerr: Yes, what we\u2019re trying to do it \u2013 I mean, obviously, we\u2019re not back to those levels yet and we don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to be back to those levels. All we\u2019re trying to do is equate to the fact that if we did get back to 2019 levels, we could do it with a significant amount, fewer aircraft, because we got \u2013 we don\u2019t have to add a bunch of aircraft to get to those levels. Our spares are down, our maintenance allocations are down, the MAX has come back, which were down in 2019. So we have a significant amount of utilization increase and gauge increase in our fleet, so that we would not have \u2013 in order for us to get to 2019 levels, the point is that we would not need anywhere near as many aircraft to get to those levels because of those things. Whether that\u2019s the right point it\u2019s a level that we know and that we were at back at that point in time, hopefully, some day in the future we will be ahead of those levels.\nJamie Baker: Sure. Would you have a corresponding ex-fuel CASM number that would then equate to the 2019 capacity?\nDerek Kerr: No, we don\u2019t have that right now. Yes.\nJamie Baker: And second, I came into the call mark and I also curious on with the net proceeds of PSP were going to be in it. And I think you answered this in response to Savi\u2019s question. So is the $300 million in incremental labor the only thing we net out? Or were there any other additional operating costs?\nDerek Kerr: That\u2019s what you would net out.\nJamie Baker: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Take care.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen. You may begin.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. Doug, you\u2019ve been very close to Washington and you\u2019ve done a lot to get this PSP in place. Has there been any discussion, and maybe it\u2019s too early in the new administration, about changes going forward once we get post-pandemic to capital controls or anything else that would ensure the industry remains solvent in the event there is another crisis?\nDoug Parker: No. No, we have not. No, we certainly haven\u2019t asked for that. So nothing like that, Helane.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, that was my main question. And then the other thing is when you look at the fleet with, I think, you said eliminating five types and down to where you are now, and having 11.5 years. How does that compare from an ESG perspective? Like what will your \u2013 if your carbon goals were to be half by 2050, what would the new goals be now? Like where would you be in say 2030 or 2035? Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Yes, I\u2019ll try, Helane. The goals we already have in place are required things like this improvement. So you\u2019re right. This is helpful to younger fleet, this is helpful to environment in terms of \u2013 and we at American have done a lot in that regard already, where we have the youngest fleet now it gets slightly younger even though years go on through this. So we\u2019re proud of that. But that\u2019s a big part of our commitment to get to carbon neutrality is continuing to have a moderate fleet. We\u2019ve done with these retirements.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: And our next question will from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. You may begin.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe a question for Doug or Derek, following up on Hunter's, do you feel comfortable from a legal standpoint selling stock into this market? And how quickly can you increase your \u2013 I guess, your authorization?\nDoug Parker: Yes, Joe, there is kind of others reference coming on, again, to Derek comment on other stuff. So I'll first comment on. Again as [indiscernible] we still have $118 million left on our previously announced after market equity authorization. And if we choose to do anything more than that, we obviously will need to inform our investors. But right now, that's what we have to tell you. There's $180 million on the ATM equity authorization. And whether or not we choose to do that or feel comfortable doing that, we can't talk about.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then Vasu, can you just quantify maybe what gauge looks like on the other side of this relative to pre-COVID? And then if you could just walk through the four geographic entities and speak to maybe the structural impact to capacity based on the fleet actions, if that makes sense? Thank you.\nVasu Raja: Yes. We indeed, we will be getting a material on updating. And as you probably hear from Derek's comments, by the time we get to December, we have the ability to produce 2019s level of capacity on about 110 fewer airplanes. And that will be gauge increase of about 4%.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Didora from Bank of America. You may begin. \nAndrew Didora: Hey, good morning, everyone. All of my questions have already been answered. But just one for one for Derek, I know you're talking about a net cash flow in from CapEx, can you just give us the gross aircraft CapEx number, how much financing you're assuming there. I'm just trying to understand the bridge to that inflow number. Thanks. \nDerek Kerr: Yes. Gross aircraft CapEx, it's about $1.1 billion as the aircraft CapEx for the MAXs and NEOs. The 787s are fully-financed and direct leased to us. And that aircraft is approximately about $200 million, so positive. So we will over-finance those aircraft that are coming in and then we have as part of the settlement, we have some difference in our PDPs schedule that goes forward. So that's the difference between the $1.2 billion and the $200 million.\nAndrew Didora: That's perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. You may begin.\nScott Forbes: Hi, it's actually Scott Forbes on for Sheila. I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit more on the fleet. I mean you removed 150 aircraft from the fleet. You're going to come out of this with the youngest fleet among the network carriers. I mean, can you talk about maybe how that plays into your planning for the recovery with its route structure and how you're thinking about the competitive environment, post-COVID?\nVasu Raja: Yes. This is Vasu. Indeed, I think you gathered it from our remarks. We would be able to produce similar level of capacity much more efficiently than what we could before. It doesn't necessarily mean that we will do so, that's all going to be a function of demand. But a lot of what you see is really the schedules that are out there flying right now.  The strongest parts of our network, all of our core connecting hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Phoenix, Miami, Philip, we'll continue to be that way and be it with larger gauge airplanes we can operate there much more efficiently, right. We can stay other expenses on more seats, but also by having fewer departures in there, it's more efficient and reliable product. We were shutting fewer and fewer departures to the airspace. The biggest parts of our network, as Robert mentioned in his opening remarks that we have struggled and are really showed up through our partnerships with Alaska in the West and JetBlue in the Northeast.  And through those we anticipate the combination of those partnerships plus larger gauge airplanes in a more efficient fleet will enable us to go and do things like say 50 seat regional jets out of those markets, which are uniquely high cost, but also really challenge to airspace. And so, at large, we can go and provide more connectivity into the system, provide a better, higher-quality network for our customers and do it in a much more efficient way than what we would in 2019.\nDerek Kerr: And Vasu, I'll just add that every time we move one of those 50 seaters out, we're bringing in a two-class product, obviously, with a first-class action as Wi-Fi and engine power as well. So it's a much more compelling offer to our customers and we're really looking forward to.\nDoug Parker: Great. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, I would like to give the media a moment for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. You may begin.\nDoug Parker: Hi, Mary. Mary?\nOperator: Mary, your line is open.\nMary Schlangenstein : Sorry, I was on mute. Thank you. Hey, Doug, I know you were a little hesitant to talk about demand further out into the summer. But I'm wondering if you could talk about what you guys are seeing now in terms of spring break demand? Do you expect that that's just going to be a non-event? Or do you see travel demand picking up a little bit maybe around that period?\nDoug Parker: We will allow Vasu to give you that, Mary. Thanks.\nVasu Raja: Yes. Hey, Mary, good to hear from you, Vasu at end. And look that what makes demand and forecasting so uniquely challenging in these times is that, 75% of our booking curve happens inside of 45 days. So really so much of spring break is kind of a question mark right now. And there is different tailwinds and headwinds for what might happen with demand there right now. What we have seen, as Robert mentioned in his comments is that, since there have been more restrictions on international travel, our international bookings have roughly halved in the last seven days versus the first two weeks of January. It remains to be seen how much that trend holds certainly, a lot of our travel partners out there are working hard to go and bring testing online. And so we'll see how that goes for us. The biggest thing is to remain as nimble as possible and how we plan the airline, and we'll continue to do that through the first quarter and beyond.\nMary Schlangenstein : Great. Thank you very much. I had a quick follow-up. I noticed that you guys mentioned the DoJ and the Attorney General of New York looking into the JetBlue Northeast U.S. alliance. I'm wondering there have been some others filing objections to that. And I'm wondering if your expectation is that you may have to gear up for some kind of a second round of review by the DoT more heavy to go to a greater efforts to get that thing finally in place.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Mary. I'll give it to Steve Johnson to have that one.\nSteve Johnson: Hi, Mary, how are you doing today? Let me start by saying that both the Alaska and the JetBlue alliances that we've announced are profoundly pro-competitive and can create enormous benefit for consumers. And that's why we like them, that's why we did it and that's why we're so excited. And our partners are so excited about implementing those.  But as you know, the Department of Justice has over the last, I guess, 12 or 13 years, looked really hard at all of the agreements between airlines, including all the mergers, taken a really good look at those. And that's what they're doing in connection with our JetBlue alliance. That investigation is going to continue. My suspicion is that they're going to allow us to be implemented and see and you take a look and determine whether the benefits that we promise actually do materialize. And if they do, I think we'll be fine.\nVasu Raja: Hi Mary, the only thing I'd add to that is that, we are working very ardently both AAL and all of our partners to deliver on exactly that. We anticipate in the first quarter, we will be rolling out some pretty comprehensive frequent flyer and connectivity codeshare with customer. And in second quarter, we anticipate being able to start ramping into new markets such as Tel Aviv and Athens, and certainly with JetBlue starts the process of deeper schedule integration.\nMary Schlangenstein : Great. Thanks very much.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Mary.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. You may begin.\nDoug Parker: Hi, Alison.\nAlison Sider : Hi. I was wondering if there's been any discussion yet about what will happen after March 31 with the employees that have been recalled, if you're able to say yet whether they'll be able to stay on or if there is discussion at this point about another round of government aid.\nDoug Parker: Yes. Thanks, Alison. Anyway to state the obvious \u2013 April 1 is approaching and demand hasn't gotten much better by then. So we are definitely going to need to address this unless demand starts to pick up. We're already talking to our unions about things we might be able to do. But anyway, nothing really to report yet, other than what we had hoped, which is the demand would have picked up, maybe not so much by April but into the summers that we would be ramping up for the summer, hasn't happened yet. So we find ourselves with April 1 approaching, being concerned about this. Our unions being concerned about all work with them. I know our unions are already talking to the administration and Congress about with the current proposal to \u2013 for stimulus to be included in there. We would obviously be supportive of that. So that\u2019s what I know right now, not enough to tell you but just telling what we know which is something we're going to need to address here before too long.\nAlison Sider : Thanks. And on the management side, I know you mentioned just the cost savings of all the reductions in staff on the management side. But I guess do you worry at all at some point about brain drain? Is it hard to recruit new people into the airline, just given the state of the industry right now?\nDoug Parker: Definitely. We're telling that we got brain to drain, we've got an amazing team here and frankly that those are here are engaged to do amazing work, and if anything we find ourselves, working more efficiently and better together just because there's not enough, not in terms of \u2013 not people be doing inefficient things. So I feel really good about where the team is right now. We certainly have issues like all companies do in these times, to make sure we're doing the right things to keep people engaged and retain. But so far so good. We really have an amazing team in place. It's working better together than I think we ever have, and continue.\nAlison Sider : Thanks.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Alison.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Dawn Gilbertson from USA Today. You may begin.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi, good morning, everyone. Hey two questions, the first one for you Doug, I know this proposal was just floated, but I'm unclear and you're not the only one who had said this, why you support international testing on flights but not domestic? And my second unrelated question, I'm not sure who it's for is. Can anybody give any color on what you're seeing at international airports, especially in Mexico and the Caribbean in the first few days of international testing requirements? Any problems that have cropped up anything you've had to do differently? Thank you very much.\nDoug Parker: Yes, I'll take the first one and give Rob the second one. Again we support international testing because that's about getting more people to be comfortable flying across borders. And we have worked with regularity with the administration to make that happen on very shorter. So and indeed hopeful of doing so that allows the administration to get comfortable with Airline or just to be more open allowing people from here to, for example, to begin traveling to the United States at some point. So anyway we worked together, supported with that. I didn't actually say that we weren't supportive of doing something more expansion in that. What I said is, we haven't heard \u2013 we haven't been asked to do. If we do, we certainly would want to make sure it was something that wouldn't restrict demand. We have seen drops in demand, of course, on short-orders especially and anyway, so we need to work with the administration to see what and if indeed.  There are \u2013 any thoughts about doing something at down for having American supply within America. It certainly seems like, we would like to see what if indeed there is anything there you have also just said has been floated. No one has talked to us officially about doing that. If they do, from our best to work with them make sure we can stress how safe it is to fly, and \u2013 which I know and they're improving that and we want to make sure that our customers feel comfortable in flying. Robert?\nRobert Isom: Yes. And Dawn, thanks for the question. The biggest challenge is getting word out to people that the new testing requirements have to be complied with. And to that end, we've done a terrific job of getting word out through every imaginable channel and what we found, as Alison mentioned a little bit earlier, our largest international destinations these days are kind of good. We've had \u2013 on the first half of the box, nobody seems whatsoever, all passengers they're basically boarded. So, we've also done tremendous work in all international locations and making sure that testing resources are available. And so, yes, we're seeing some customers show up without the necessary proof and we're re-accommodating them as required. But we're getting out fortunately with all the work that we've done to put tools in place like VeriFLY, the digital health passport. We're doing a pretty good job and we're going to be able to handle this.\nDawn Gilbertson: Thank you very much.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Dawn.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Leslie Josephs from CNBC. You may begin.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nDoug Parker: Hi, Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs: What are your pilot feeds and pilot training needs for summer 2020 with Delta calling back 400 pilots. Do you expect them all, including the 1,200 plus that were furloughed to be active by summer? And then, just another question on capacity going forward with these partnerships. Do you expect American continue to or do you know the percentage of how much American will sort of outsource some of this capacity, thanks to these new partnerships.\nRobert Isom: So I'll try to take both. So just in terms of pilots, the question is how much you are flying? And so to that end, it's a question mark out there. As demand comes back we know that over the long run we will have a home for all of our pilots, certainly those that have been furloughed in the past and hopefully that we will be able to keep everybody on board. And just because of the pilots and retirement age, we anticipate that we will be hiring pilots in the not too distant future.  Now, second question was in terms of \u2026\nLeslie Josephs: And having not playing your own metal versus \u2013\nRobert Isom: Oh, yes, in terms of \u2013 yeah, thanks for that as well. The relationships are not about outsourcing any shape or form. It's all about better utilizing those assets we have in finding ways in the long run for growth for us. And these partnerships are really creative in that sense that they're going to be able to allow American Airlines to do what it does best, both domestically and internationally. So prospects in terms of the work that we do for the long run is very, very bright.\nDoug Parker: Yes. And as a team that we are really pro-consumer and what that means is that, you're going to generate more demand just because we can connect with each other. So we think that's actually more flying for American Airlines \u2013 more bigger airplanes and smaller airplanes for example in New York because we're able to compete better against other airlines who have larger networks in those areas we do.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. And just one follow-up, do you have any expectation of how long American will be so domestic-focused versus a pre-pandemic global network?\nVasu Raja: Well, hey, this is Vasu. And right now, a lot of what you see in our asset footprint is more just we're operating with where indeed there is demand. As you go and look out there and now March schedule \u2013 sorry, February and March schedule, you'll see that Latin America network that we're operating is indeed in many cases larger than what was there before the pandemic because that is the place where we see demand, and heard Alison and Robert comment, a place where we see a lot of testing getting stood up pretty quickly.  And so for us, international will really be a function coming back. Again international bring that will be really a product of where demand is and how that test can get ramped up.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Tracy Rucinski from Reuters. You may begin.\nDoug Parker: Hey Tracy.\nTracy Rucinski: Hi. Good morning. Hi. So, given the strong rise in shares this morning, are you planning an equity offering or anything to de-lever the balance sheet?\nDoug Parker: Yes, Tracy. So we said at the start of this comment on the recent stock price movement. What we did say is that $180 million of authority on a previously announced after market equity authorization and as well, we might get in the future we can talk about.\nTracy Rucinski: I apologize. I missed that.\nDoug Parker: That's okay. There are lot going on now. Thanks, Tracy.\nTracy Rucinski: Thanks.\nDoug Parker: Bye.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Koenig from The Associated Press. You may begin.\nDavid Koenig: Hey, guys. Good morning everybody. At the risk of maybe rephrasing something that you're kind of getting at in what Mary and Dawn's questions. I wonder if you can talk about how much travel restrictions, including what we saw from the U.S. this week. And how the travel restrictions are changing your view about the pace of recovery this summer? And then secondly, what impact would you see if there is a testing requirement for domestic flights?\nDoug Parker: All right, Dave. I'll try it. So first off, travel restrictions, again, international has resulted in reduction in demand for international travel. But as we say couple of times now, we expect that to improve as it becomes easier for people get those tests, which is happening already. And certainly it will have an impact on demand and customers need to present a positive test to travel and we're seeing that particularly in the short-haul international travel things like Mexico and the Caribbean, non-U.S. Caribbean destinations. As it relates to any other travel restrictions, things like mask mandates, we've been doing mask mandates well before it was mandated by the government, we intend to keep continue doing that way. It was great things. We will continue to do so anything we want to make sure that the government doesn't put in place, exemptions other than the ones we have with children of two years old. So we are huge proponents of mask mandates, huge proponents of what the administration is trying to accomplish, and that's what we've been asked to do so far, we are asked to do more.  We'll do aim to impress, our desire to let right now we have a shared objective, which is to get the P&L behind as fast as we can, allow our country to keep moving. In the meantime people are driving from state-to-state, and they're flying from state-to-state. They're doing so safely. And we just want to make sure that we continue that to happen with the goal of making sure, we get rid of the pandemic as soon as possible. I know the administration shares that goal and I suspect anything we come up with will be consistent with that.\nDavid Koenig: Okay. Thanks. I think that's more concise. And you must have an opinion though about what impact do you see if there is a domestic flight testing requirement?\nDoug Parker: I have to say what I understand, I was with them.\nDavid Koenig: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that ends the media Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Doug Parker for any closing remarks.\nDoug Parker : All right, thank you very much for your interest. We will meet again. Just going to proud of our team on what they're doing. It gives great confidence as we go forward. I know everyone interested in how fast, things will rebound. We don't know the answer to that. We've done it well. But when it does, we're going to be there ready to take care of people when they want to travel. And we're ready to withstand, how long it may take because of the great job Derek and team have done to get our company to its financial position. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "AAL", "quarter": 3, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-10-22 17:44:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the American Airlines Group Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead.\nDan Cravens: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the American Airlines third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. In the room on the call this morning, we have Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call for our Q&A session are several of our Senior Execs, including Maya Liebman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Vasu Raja, our Chief Revenue Officer; Alison Taylor, our Chief Customer Officer; and David Seymour, our Chief Operating Officer. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and the actions we\u2019re taking during this pandemic. Robert will then follow with some remarks about our initiative. And after Robert's remarks, Derek will follow with the details on our liquidity and cost outlook. After Derek\u2019s comments, we will open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecasts of capacity, fleet plans and liquidity. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site. A webcast of this call will be also archived on our Web site. Information that we\u2019re giving you on the call is as of today\u2019s date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us. And at this point, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining us. So there is no doubt, this continues to be an unprecedented time for our entire industry, our team and our customers. At American, we continue to take actions so we can manage this pandemic and position our airline for success when demand returns. So I'm going to start with a quick summary of our results for the quarter, which were improved early in the year but still reflecting extremely challenging environment we're in today. Our third quarter pretax loss excluding net special items was $3.6 billion. Our revenues were down 73% year-over-year. In this environment, we continue to focus on controlling what we can, reducing costs and cash burn are at front and center. In total, we removed approximately $17 billion in costs from our business, and our cash burn rate declined markedly versus second quarter. We ended the quarter with a proforma liquidity balance of approximately $15.6 billion, which is much more liquidity than we've ever had before and more than double where we began this year. And customer confidence is gradually beginning to return. We continue to evolve in this new era of travel. The foundation of all that of course is our incredible team. These are difficult times for sure and we couldn't be prouder of how the American team is handling this situation. Our team is out there keeping our company moving, safely transporting hundreds of thousands of people around the globe every day. And we're doing an excellent job of generating revenue in this environment, which is making a difference both for American Airlines and the United States in general. That's why it\u2019s so difficult to see our October 1st pass without having the payroll support program with the CARES Act extended, both in support of our team and the commercial aviation infrastructure, it's going to be critical to an economic rebound. There's enormous bipartisan support for an extension but unfortunately, our elected officials still haven't been able to get it enacted, because they've been unable to agree on broader COVID relief legislation. So without the extension we had to furlough 1,900 of our team members beginning October 1st and we did continue to service numerous markets around the country. We remain hopeful that our elected officials can come together on this important legislation on behalf of our team, our industry and working Americans in our economy at large. Elections matter but there's nothing pulling higher than support for a COVID relief stimulus package. And PSP extension will be an important component of any such package. Robert and Derek is going to talk more about our results and our path forward. We know that every action we took in the third quarter, centered around on our aggressive plan to bolster liquidity, conserve cash and ensure that customers can fly with complete confidence when they travel with American. On the liquidity front, American, as I said, ended the third quarter with approximately $13.6 billion of available liquidity and $15.6 billion when you pro forma for an additional $2 billion and authorized capacity through the CARES Act loan program, which was finalized just this week. And also this morning, we announced, on top of that authorization to issue up to $1 billion of equity in an aftermarket offering. As a conserving cash in this environment, we're focusing on what we can control. To that end, we've been -- we worked relentlessly to rightsize all aspects of the airline. This has been done primarily through cost savings resulting from reduced flying and long-term structural changes to our fleet and our infrastructure. We continue to realize the benefits, both financially and operationally, accelerating the retirement of more than 150 aircraft from our fleet. And thanks for these efforts, I look gradual improvements in the revenue environment. We continue to bring down our daily cash burn. Our burn rate improved by approximately $14 million per day during the third quarter from $58 million down to $44 million, and we expect our fourth quarter burn rate to be improved even more to between $25 million and $30 million per day, and we expect that number to continue to drop going forward as demand for our travel continues to gradually improve. Also during to the third quarter we continued our focused plan to capture the travel demand that does exist. Remarkably, one in every three domestic passengers flew in an American Airlines flight during the third quarter. And if we could say one thing to every American Airlines customer is that it\u2019s safe to fly. Others have shared this data as well but certainly worth repeating, IATA we estimates that 1.2 billion people flown so far in 2020 and among that group, there are only 44 cases of COVID-19 in which transmission is believed to have been associated with air travel. So it's clear that our efforts are working as an industry, even with our team members, being on the front lines and working through the pandemic to support our communities and serve our customers. Our team has a lower rate of COVID-19 infections than the national average. And notably, we've seen fewer cases with our airborne team members, our pilots and flight attendants than with our other work groups. And I\u2019ve personally been flying multiple times every week and I see it everywhere I go, the level of cleaning, the safety measures and the diligence from our team and our customers. It\u2019s truly incredible and we are greatly appreciative. So in closing, we know we have a long road ahead of us. But our entire team remains fully engaged and we couldn't be prouder of the amazing work they're doing each and every day. We're focused on not just getting through this pandemic, but making sure we're prepared to succeed as demand returns and we're highly confident that we're going to adjust that. So with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. So with that I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I want to second my appreciation to the entire American Airlines team. Despite this year\u2019s remarkable challenges, they continue to rise to the occasion and delivered for our customers and each others when it's most needed, and we're incredibly grateful. Taking care of our team and customers continues to be our top priority. We're taking additional steps in recent weeks to provide customers further peace of mind as they returned to the skies. We upgraded our clean commitment by adding SurfaceWise2 to our safety program. SurfaceWise2 is approved by the EPA as a long-lasting product to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, and it will be applied to America's entire fleet in the coming months. We've also made travel easier and less complicated by eliminating change fees and allowing customers to stand by on earlier flight on the same-day at no charge. These customer-focused initiatives, along with changes to our basic economy product and new advantage leap benefits, give travelers tremendous flexibility when they fly American. Additionally, we launched a new travel tool to help customers quickly see the current COVID-19 travel guidelines for domestic and international destinations. As we entered the third quarter, the U.S. saw an increase in COVID-19 cases, which was followed by a slowdown in demand. We responded quickly and efficiently in a way that maintains scale at our largest connected hubs in DFW and Charlotte. Our approach has paid off as evidenced by our passenger revenue results. Notably, DFW and Charlotte were our best performing hubs year-over-year. Our cargo team continues to do outstanding work driving revenue and supporting the global economy during the pandemic. We more than doubled our cargo only flying from August to September and operating more than 1,900 flights, serving 32 destinations during the third quarter. To date, these cargo flights have helped our customers move more than 85 million pounds of critical goods around the world amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. And despite a nearly 60% reduction in system capacity in the third quarter, our cargo revenue was effectively flat year-over-year. During the quarter, we started to see signs of a slow but steady recovery in passenger demand. Although domestic net bookings finished the quarter down 50%, this was an improvement from the first part of July when bookings were down 80%. During the month of September, 45% of domestic flights had a load factor greater than 80% compared to just 25% in July. As we look ahead with one third of our flights being actively managed by our yield management system, we see improving yield curves in the coming months. And we aren't just waiting for customers to come to us, we're taking steps to reopen markets to travel through pre-flight COVID-19 testing. Testing options are now available to customers traveling to Hawaii and Costa Rica, with Jamaica and the Bahamas following soon. And we're engaged in efforts to expand that program across the Caribbean. These testing programs are important because they will ultimately help to reopen markets by further inspiring confidence in travel. The pandemic has changed our business in many ways that we could have never expected but the American team has reimagined how to deliver a safe, healthy and enjoyable travel experience for our customers. Pre-flight COVID-19 testing is a great example of that and it's going to be an important part of advancing the industry's recovery from the pandemic. Our approach to fourth quarter capacity is straightforward. We'll continue to focus on our large connecting cuts at DFW and Charlotte and to put capacity in markets that are showing positive recovery, such as the Sunbelt, Mexico and the markets that are opening in the Caribbean. We expect our fourth quarter system capacity to be down slightly more than 50% year-over-year with long-haul international capacity down approximately 75% year-over-year. While we're encouraged with the trends we're seeing in our net bookings, we'll continue to remain as flexible as possible and let demand serve as our guide for future capacity levels. As we look across the competitive landscape, we believe there is no network better positioned than Americas. First, our network is big in the markets where customers want to go. With our Sunbelt hubs in Charlotte, Miami, DFW and Phoenix, we have seen demand resilience throughout the pandemic. This combined with our easy access to mountain and sea destinations provides an outlet for customers to redefine the meaning of working remotely or just get away. Secondly, we have the best short-haul international network with the largest presence in Mexico and the Caribbean. Demand for this region has been strong. And based on current trends, we expect our fourth quarter revenue for this region to reach 70% of 2019 levels. Third, now is the time to be creative and find smart ways to strengthen our hubs in key markets. With our recently announced domestic partnerships with Alaska and JetBlue, we are raising the competitive bar and expanding our network in an asset-light manner while providing customers with more choice and a world class product. Importantly, our extensive engagement with leisure operators is delivering results in the segment that is leading a recovery. And to that end, American was recently named Airline Partner of the Year by the American Society of Travel Advisers for the second year in a row. So in conclusion, we remain committed to making sure our customers feel safe and comfortable and have flexibility when they travel. As we continue to manage the current environment, we remain focused on being flexible and nimble in all parts of the organization. And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported a GAAP net loss of $2.4 billion or $4.71 per share in the third quarter. During the quarter, we recognized $540 million of pretax net special items. Net special items included a $2.1 billion credit resulting from the payroll support program financial assistance, which was offset in part by $875 million of severance costs associated with our voluntary and involuntary headcount reductions and $742 million fleet impairment charge. Excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $2.8 billion or $5.54 per share. With the prolonged decline in passenger demand, our primary focus has been to ensure we have the financial strength for a range of recovery scenarios. We have moved quickly to raise incremental liquidity, reduce cash burn and become as efficient as possible. On the revenue front, our third quarter total revenue was $3.2 billion, down 73% year-over-year on a 59% reduction in total capacity. While our revenue was down materially, it was nearly double what it was in the second quarter. We expect fourth quarter to be down approximately 65%. While our current booking trends are positive, they're still down significantly and we continue to plan for a slow recovery. As Robert mentioned, we expect our fourth quarter capacity to be down slightly more than 50% year-over-year. We have worked hard to rebuild our fleet into one of the more efficient to operate and offers our customers a consistent and improved product and experience. Our team has been actively engaged with Boeing and Airbus to provide flexibility in how we manage our fleet, giving us ample opportunity to adjust as demand conditions warrant. As announced this morning in our earnings press release, we have reached an agreement with Boeing to secure deferral rights on 8 of our 2021 Max deliveries and all 10 of our Max deliveries in 2022. If the deferral rates are ultimately exercised, these aircraft can be deferred to the second half of 2023 through the first quarter of 2024. To avoid exercising these deferral rates, we would need to see substantial improvement in the demand environment. During the quarter, we finalized a series of sale-leaseback transactions to finance our remaining A320 aircraft deliveries in 2021. As a result, we now have financing for all of our planned aircraft deliveries through 2021. As we have spoken about in the past, our long-held strategy has been to drive efficiencies through the simplification of our fleet. With the permanent retirement of our A330-200 fleet announced this morning, we now have only four aircraft types in our mainline fleet: 737, the A320 family, 787 and 777. Aside from the scale and fuel efficiencies, the operating efficiencies on the crew, maintenance and schedule are permanent. We also continue to pursue the harmonization of our 737 and A321 fleets and expect to have all of our 737 aircraft operating in the same configuration by the end of the first quarter of 2021. We expect to have our A321 fleet harmonized by the spring of 2022. When combined with our fleet simplification strategy, these steps provide significant opportunities to improve revenue production and reduce costs now and well into the future. Lastly, we retain inexpensive optionality in our total fleet count as we have 51 aircraft with lease expirations through the end of 2022. In addition, we have more than 200 older owned mainline and regional aircraft that could be efficiently part should demand conditions deteriorate. We continue to take a zero based approach to our expense planning and have moved quickly to better align our costs with our reduced schedule, producing the $17 billion reduction in 2022 expenditures that Doug talked about. As we look to our team members, in addition to the cost reduction efforts we've outlined in the previous quarters, more than 20,000 team members have opted for an early retirement or long-term lease. This is in addition to the painful but necessary process of furloughing 19,000 team members. We are extremely grateful for the sacrifice and contributions these team members have made to our airline. Finally, on liquidity. We continue to take proactive steps to reduce our cash burn rate, improve our total liquidity position. In the third quarter, our operational cash burn rate was approximately $36 million per day and our debt principal and severance burn was approximately $8 million per day. In total, our third quarter average cash burn rate was approximately $44 million per day, which improved sequentially from the second quarter burn rate of $58 million per day. During the quarter, we closed both Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank secured notes financings totaling $1.2 billion, in addition to the CARES Act loan, Doug mentioned, that provided $5.5 billion of loan capacity. We also received the final payments of our allotted PSP funds, including an incremental $168 million of previously unallocated funds identified by the U.S. treasury. This week, we were able to increase the amount available under the CARES Act loan to $7.5 billion. When combined with our third quarter ending liquidity balance of $13.6 billion, we ended the third quarter with a pro forma liquidity balance of approximately $15.6 billion. This morning, we also announced the authorization to issue up to $1 billion of equity in an aftermarket offering to further bolster liquidity. We view this as another lever that the company has available at any time. As we look to the fourth quarter, we presently expect to end the quarter with more than $13 billion of total available liquidity, which excludes any proceeds from the ATM offering I just mentioned. This resulted in an average cash burn rate of between 25 million and $30 million per day, which includes debt principal and interest and severance payments. Our goal remains to get our daily cash burn rate to zero as quickly as possible. The timing of reaching this goal continues to be dependent on the demand recovery time line as many of our cost reductions have already been finalized. In terms of our debt obligations, we believe the market is underappreciating our balance sheet flexibility and efficiency. Approximately 40% of our outstanding debt is prepayable without penalty and we don't have any large non-aircraft debt maturities until our $750 million unsecured bond matures in 2022. Lastly, thanks to the tireless efforts of our treasury team, our weighted average cost of debt is just over 4% despite higher coupon COVID-related financings that we completed this year. While we continue to be pleased with the outcomes of our recent financings, the incremental debt to our balance sheet and dilution to our shareholders has been significant. However, with the flexibility that I've outlined, we have the ability to proactively repay debt and delever our balance sheet over the next several years when we return to a normalized revenue environment. To conclude, we still have a long road to recovery ahead of us. However, the actions we have taken to conserve cash, bolster liquidity and support our team members and customers give us confidence that we are well prepared when demand returns. And with that, I'll open it up the line with analysts for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Look, I know it's a really difficult environment right now, and a lot of airlines are still burning through cash. But as we look forward, this is a real ability for the industry to rebuild itself and more specifically, American. But I guess, what is the strategy going forward, guys? Because you will have a pretty large debt balance. And I think competitor down across the city there won't have that much and a lower cost structure. So in that type of environment, how do you navigate to differentiate and have the ability to pay down debt and be profitable? What's the new American going to look look like?\nDoug Parker: We're going to be more efficient. That's for certain. We're using this opportunity. It's really -- it's horrific as all this is, it does provide some amazing opportunity to think largest airline in the world and effectively shut it down and build back on that, that makes sense. We've done things like reduce 30% of our management. We're not going to bring that back. We've accelerated the retirement of 150 aircraft and aircraft types that aren't going to come back. So and more and more, like as we do and as we build back the schedule, we're going to build back flying that is profitable and take out a lot of what used to exist that was less so. So we feel really good about how we will emerge from this, both vis-\u00e0-vis where we used to be and vis-\u00e0-vis our competitive positioning. We do indeed have higher debt levels we did before this because we had gone and modernized our fleet. So that's behind us. We don't have, as Derek noted, large amortizations in the near term. We certainly don't think once we to where we're generating cash, you're going to see us needing to do any more in terms of raising more. And we'll do as we move to cash positive as we'll use those proceeds to pay down the debt. And I think you'll see from our competitors. But we feel really good about our ability to compete in the future as the industry gets cash positive, and as American gets cash positive, we'll use our proceeds to pay down debt first.\nBrandon Oglenski: And I guess if we are going to be a more leisure-oriented market for a few years, is there a fear that the fair structure in the industry could walk lower? Do you think you're going to have a cost structure to compete in an environment like that?\nDoug Parker: Yes, of course. Because we have a route network it can do that. I\u2019m going to get Vasu expand more or Robert. But the reality is we have a huge competitive advantage in terms of our ability to connect customers around the United States and internationally when that rebounds the sub and spoke network of ours that there\u2019s many other carriers can\u2019t compete with, couple can but not all, that\u2019s a great revenue generator. We of course will need to have our cost in line with that. Like I said, we\u2019re going to get our costs down through the efficiencies I spoke. But now, again, like I said, our cash burn number now is being similar to where our competitors are. As the industry gradually rebounds, we\u2019ll rebound at a similar rate. You\u2019ll see our cash levels, and therefore, our earnings -- our cash burn levels and our earnings rebound as the industry does. Vasu, anything else you want to add\u2026\nVasu Raja: What I'd just to add to it, Brandon, is look those exited historically thought business and leisure is having a very different yield performance as across our system that is not always the case indeed in our airline business style revenue, there's a people who don't stay at Saturday nights, midweek travel, single person in the itinerary about a third of our revenue but only about third of that comes from the large global corporates that are most likely to delay travel. And even -- so one, we're actually less exposed to that historically have been than what may mean BI, but two, the replacement value that traffic is very different for American Airlines and our largest hubs, such as Dallas Fort Worth, Charlotte, the non-corporate traffic that's on the airplane can often produce yield that are between 70% to 75% of the corporates but indeed the non-corporate yield that what you might call the leisure yield in some of these hubs outperformed corporate yields in some of the big coastal metro areas that are there. So really the strength of the American Airlines business is that so much of what we do we create connectivity for customers that really wouldn't exist if it weren't for American Airlines flying in some of these markets. So that's a core attribute of our business model. That will be something that takes us through this crisis and will absolutely be part of what powers the revenue production of the airline on the other end of it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. Two very quick ones here. Derek, the $25 million to $30 million of burn. What is that number if we were -- or you could just tell us roughly what -- is the piece that's related to debt interest principal payment and severance? Just to do an\u2026\nDerek Kerr: In the fourth quarter, it's $8 million. It's the same in the third and fourth quarter. So it's $8 million in principle and interest payments in that $25 million.\nMike Linenberg: And then just second, you guys have done a nice job on the cost side, pulling down costs, I think ex fuel profit -- ex fuel and specials I think you\u2019re down about 30%. What do you feel -- where the things shake out for the fourth quarter, given the fact that you will have a bit more people off the table, et cetera. What should we be looking at?\nDerek Kerr: We had reductions in costs as we look at, it was 40% in the third quarter. And as we add --we're adding back a little bit of capacity. So we said 59% down in the third quarter and close to 52%. So we add probably a little bit of cost due to capacity coming back in. So we should be in a similar range, maybe 38% -- 36% to 38% range cost down in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Derek, you talked about balance sheet flexibility and efficiency and your ability to pay down debt, you need to generate cash, obviously, to do that. Part of that is [CapEx]. So if you want the market to better appreciate your ability to repair the balance sheet, can you provide some visibility around CapEx over the next few years?\nDerek Kerr: Yeah. As we look at CapEx, I mean we've already pulled down '21 and '22. So we were at 17 and we pulled $800 million out of '21, we pulled $200 million out of '22. So we would be at about $1 billion dollars is the run rate and we can take that lower also. We just -- right now we're at that run rate and we and we definitely can take it lower if there's -- if we need to. From a CapEx perspective, we're sitting at about $1 billion in 2021 and about $1.7 billion in 2022. Now I also said that we have deferral write down aircraft and we can push that, that would reduce those two CapEx numbers out in the years. And as you know, we don't have many deliveries in '23 and '24. So the CapEx profile is much, much smaller than we've had over the past years and we will be able to use that cash that was going to buy aircraft and integrate the airlines and for paying down debt.\nJoseph DeNardi: And then thought why was American\u2019s earnings power and margins so much lower than peers pre-COVID and why will that change on the other side of that? Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: I think its a great question, and there is a range of answers for it. But I will at least pick on one that we are experiencing emerging in the trends right now, which is just how we adjust capacity across our network. As you look at 3Q results right now, our relative PRASM performance in the system is strong versus our competitors that kind of an empty victory in the environment we're in but it's an important lesson. Because what we see right now is that about 75% of our airlines capacity is in our four biggest hubs. And if those hubs were producing basically what we see today 30%, 40% RASM premiums to the industry. Our smallest hubs that we see today are 10% of our capacity and still producing around the deficit. While in the old days that was a much bigger mix. The things that weren\u2019t outperforming on a RASM basis were in some cases as big as Dallas, Fort Worth, our largest hub. So look what that means for us is as it relates to an earlier question is that as we come out of here, one of our really guiding principles is that we will produce a revenue premium to the industry. The way we go about doing that is first and foremost that we worry more about organic assets in the markets where we can produce an outsized level of value for customers, which as we see today produces an outsized level of revenue for the airlines that too through many of the partnerships that we\u2019ve created, not just with Alaska and JetBlue but with British Airways, or IAG, or JAL, or many others around the world in markets where we can't produce outsized customer value alone. We're going to work with these partners to make sure that we produce that value and get the returns that come with it. And third and very important too, we need to go and increase across our commercial divisions, give our customers really good reasons to want to fly more and have some more, which sounds very simple and indeed it is. But we think that by doing that there's a real path out of it where American can produce at a different level than it might have before.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker: If on the stimulus program, if nothing's opened and people don't travel by March, won't the industry be in the same place as it is now and need more stimulus money? Isn't it better to work with governors to open, and then get more stimulus money rather than getting it now?\nDoug Parker: Helane, again -- let me separate two things. Stimulus of course, entire COVID repay is what has stimulated the economy. I think it\u2019s really important. And I think the sooner the better, I think our country needs it and that would help in many ways too, I think. As to the payroll support plan extension, that\u2019s not about stimulus in our view, that's about keeping critical infrastructure in place. That's about the importance of the airline industry to that economic recovery is entirely what the PSP program was put in place to do. What it does is it has airlines keep more people employed than we would otherwise. Basically existing demand has us serve markets we wouldn\u2019t serve otherwise, it\u2019s basically existing demand. And the concept was that the government as a pass through gives money to airlines to pay those people and to fly those flights that we wouldn\u2019t fly otherwise. So as the economy returns that critical infrastructure is in place. I think that's good policy. I think it\u2019s been great policy up to date and I think it\u2019s good policy that should be extended. And I'm not alone in that and there\u2019s enormous bipartisan support for that, for exacting those reasons. It's not about getting money into airlines. It\u2019s about making sure that critical infrastructure stays in place. So yeah, I think that's really important to keep in place now. I feel that absent an extension you will see some of that infrastructure decline. And as the economy looks to rebound, we won't be prepared as well as we should be to facilitate that rebound. So that's what it's about. And so therefore I don't think it makes sense. We\u2019ll have that critical infrastructure get harmed or to go lower again, like I said, we\u2019re not alone on that than others. Virtually everyone we talked to that agrees that should happen. So I guess part of the question -- there\u2019s another question we sometimes hear, which is well okay that's all well and good. But if things won\u2019t be better six months from now that you're going to need it again. I don't think so. I happen to believe we're seeing now even in this environment gradual return of revenues. We expect that to continue. I think six months from now certainly you'll see a better environment than we have today irrespective of what may or may not have happened as it relates to the pandemic itself, because people are getting more and more comfortable with travel and cities are opening up and business is returning somewhat. So I think six months from now that certainly we\u2019ve got -- and from an airline cyclicality perspective, we'll be headed into a summer, which is always -- has higher demand. So anyway at least our view any way is that six months and PSP extension would be the less PSP extension you would need to keep that infrastructure in place. But after that we're not going to be in a good position to do what people want us to do, which is to be here to help the economy rebound.\nHelane Becker: And then my other question, how many aircraft are actually being scheduled right now?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Helane, the easier way to do it is how many how many airplanes are we not flying, and that that number is the order of magnitude of about 200 jets. We have a couple of airplanes that fly on relatively lazy like good. It makes some of the maintenance of the operations of the airline easier [Multiple Speakers]\u2026\nDoug Parker: 200 out of\u2026\nUnidentified Company Representative: Out of 1,350.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Hunter Kay of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nHunter Kay: Derek, your revenue in 3Q was like $3.2 billion. What were your cash receipts maybe net of refunds in the quarter?\nDerek Kerr: Revenue was about 75/25 from a revenue perspective. So we did burn some of the store value during the quarter. Our ABL still has about year-to-date about $4.9 billion at the end of the third quarter, and there's about $2.5 billion that is still stored value that was from refunds and other things that were given out during the early part of COVID.\nHunter Kay: And then I\u2019ve had a question for Alison actually. I'm asking you this question given your comment of the importance of TMCs and the press release you put out with the new Sabre deal. How much did you spend on TMC commissions in 2019, just roughly? And how much is your budget -- how much are you being given to spend on agency commissions in 2021 and 2022, relative to what you said about the importance of agencies as business travel recovers and of course obviously the elephant in the room, the competitiveness of the corporate travel landscape that has evolved over the next couple of years.\nAlison Taylor: So, it's a tricky one for our TMCs and our agencies, and we believe and always making sure our agencies are accordant partners for us, but there\u2019s still a tight important new corporate business. We\u2019re still working out what that would be, because as you know we still are looking at the return of corporate business on the hope of the larger contracts global accounts being later in '21. So it's little hard at the moment to predict what those commissions will be. Although, I would say it continue to be important for us and we believe once again they will be robust partners in the latter half of '21. We are also working with them to open up markets like the cargo between the UK and the USA. And so they are also facilitating in those markets, it\u2019s something as the important initiative for them.\nDerek Kerr: So Alison with the kind of charter, we haven't gone through the budget process for 2021 and we will go through that process and figure out the right amount that we need to do for -- to get the corporate back.\nDoug Parker: Yes, and Hunter, just one thing. Given our scale of American and our ability to serve corporate customers, it is really American that is out there increasing commission rates in an effort to attract business travel. So don't think you will see that would be the case in the future for that but we do all the major match others are and we need to be competitive. But it\u2019s not happened and Alison is not but one who is out there creating up commissions in general.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jamie Baker of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nJamie Baker: Couple for Derek presumably and first based on the October 1st furloughs and the accompanying service suspensions, what's the estimated level of cost savings there either on a quarterly or annual basis?\nDerek Kerr: I think we\u2019ve got as we put together how much of savings we have got from a management perspective, it was about half a billion dollars that we had in the management side of things. The amount from efficiencies and other things that we got out from some of the management -- some of the labor was about $400 million. So from a headcount perspective, we're right around billion dollars of permanent efficiencies and headcount from those two areas. So on $17 billion, a billion of it is definitely stuff that doesn't come back. Fleet reductions is another area where we will see significant savings. And then the other part is as we add back in the cost, as Doug said earlier, as we add back in the flying how do we do that more efficiently to drive those costs down, and keep most of the -- keep everything we can from the savings that we've had in 2020 permanent as we move forward.\nJamie Baker: But the aircraft savings, I mean, you're not counting that as part of the PSP exercise. I mean what I'm getting at is that in the event of another round of PSP, certain costs are going to be added back to the P&L but then effectively taken out by the PSP. So what I'm really trying to calculate is what impact PSP would have on liquidity. So your air craft comment is helpful, but that's separate. Correct?\nDerek Kerr: Yes, that is separate from PSP. PSP is all headcount related.\nJamie Baker: And we should be assuming, so your net number on that was about a billion annually. Correct?\nDerek Kerr: With the amount of reductions from furlough, that's about $1 billion, $1.5 billion annually.\nJamie Baker: And then again, so on the planned retirement, I guess you're out of five aircraft families all together? What level longer term of cost, is that permanently removed? And if your estimate net of any revenue inefficiencies, maybe this is question for Vasu, that might occurs since you all just had somewhat fewer options in terms of aircraft gauge?\nDerek Kerr: From a cost perspective, I think there's two things. One is from a cost perspective, we should have a permanent reduction in those aircraft coming out, because you have maintenance coming out, you have all the stuff coming out. So that could be anywhere from -- I mean, we haven't calculated '20 and '21 plan yet. And as we just retired the 330, 200s this morning and we still have some 737s that are on the ground, whether they come back up as we move forward. But that's half of billion dollars in this year and then that stays in next year from a maintenance and a cost perspective as we go forward. I know Vasu can add to that\u2026\nVasu Raja: Jamie, from a revenue perspective the really nice thing about the retirement is that we've really accelerated where we wanted to be down the road. So I think one of the things that we had said before is that we were looking for efficiencies just because of the different number of aircraft type seating configurations, and also when you take into account regional partners, the number of operators as well. So over the course of last five years, we've gone from really over 50 different sub fleet types down to now about I think 23 or so. And in terms of being able to serve the marketplace, we're ending up with fleet families that really worked well. So from a 320 family perspective, what we -- we\u2019re not losing out on anything in terms of retirements like the 75s. From 787, 788 and 789, we're not losing out on anything from a 76 and 330 perspective. So with the various -- in the different fleet types and the same holds true for our regionals, I think we've got the fleet to serve the spectrum of demand needs and doing it in a way that\u2019s incredibly efficient.\nJamie Baker: And Derek, just remaining unencumbered assets number and then I\u2019ll be done.\nDerek Kerr: We have about $4 billion of unencumbered assets and we have $7 billion of first lien capability. So around $11 billion.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Vernon of Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nDavid Vernon: I wanted to ask the post-COVID cross question in a slightly different way. If you were to take a look at the actions you've taken on the fleet side that assumes some normal level of utilization. How would the gauge shifts, like if you were to just take a snapshot in 2019, what does our gauge look like pre-COVID? What's it going to look like in the future? And then if you think about the reduction in hourly operating costs from all the simplification. Is there a way that you can frame kind of a cost reduction potential just on the variable hourly operating cost of the new fleet? Investors are really trying to get their heads around this issue of, okay, American's margins were ex before the crisis, what are they going to be after the crisis. And I think, getting some more tangible data points around exactly what the fleet is going to look like could be helpful here.\nDavid Seymour: This is David Seymour and I will start and other can join in. What makes this a little bit complex is we're still in the process of setting what our 2021 capacity is. So as Derek mentioned, we\u2019ve got 737s on the ground, we have 50 seaters that are on the ground depending on how those come back or not that will impact our future gauge. So let me give you more of a conceptual answer. But if you think about it right we've taken out -- and all the fleet simplification that Robert and Derek just spoke about, we have taken out roughly 50 wide bodies from December until June of this year. And what all that is, is taking out some of our lesser -- lower gauge airplanes, such as 757, 767. And now have more of our wide-body fleets are in higher gauge, higher density products, like the 787. But of course lead for the narrow body fleet certainly versus last year and years prior, there's a material impact in upgauging. First we have the 190 and the MD-80s coming out, replaced with larger gauge 737 and 321neo that are coming in. And in the regional side, we have more 50 seaters coming out, being replaced with dual class regional jets. And so all of that is a pretty material impact and in the months ahead we\u2019ll get a better sense for that average gauge year over year. But just doing the basic fleet math and you can probably get a pretty good sense for what that impact is.\nUnidentified Company Representative: And we kind of looking at over '19 just because the '20 is so strange. But I hate we\u2019ll have -- our average seat in '19 from a main line was about 167. And as we do the Oasis projects and all the changes of the aircraft that should go up somewhere in the neighborhood of 5% and five seats and then regional as we make that change on the regional you\u2019re going to get about three more seats as we make the change there. So there will be a significant -- as we look into 2021 departures should be down and gauge should be up, so that will give us a cost benefit from a CASM perspective as we fly less departures at higher gauge at lower cost.\nDavid Vernon: And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. Could you talk a little bit about kind of rebuilding the regional footprint and the seater footprint? Is there going to be a shift in the old model versus the contracted model? Or how do you -- are you thinking about kind of how to start to rebuild fleet traffic as you start to look at what the network is going look like post-COVID?\nUnidentified Company Representative: We've done a really nice job over the years of following a strategy that speaks to simplification, in terms of fleet types and simplification in terms of number of operators with PSA and Envoy and just really, at this point, a few partner carriers. We feel like we\u2019re in a really good spot and with carriers that are established and all fighting on the basis of quality and efficiency. So we feel pretty good about it. In terms of building backs, of course, putting the larger two class regional jets in the service is really important. I take a look to 2021 when demand recovers, and that we open-up a new regional facility and DCA, and think about the kind of changes that we talked about with upgauging and what that will mean for the airline. It\u2019s going to be positive, not just from a cost efficiency perspective but also from revenue perspective -- but also from a passenger perspective in terms of quality of service, we're going to be able to provide them a product that they really want.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joe Caiado of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJoe Caiado: Derek, quick question for you and apologies if you answered it in your prepared remarks. But would you consider using some of the billion dollars of the equity raise to retire near-term at a significant discount? I think you mentioned your 5% unsecured notes due 2022 are sort of your next big maturity. And those are trading at about $0.70 on the $1. So is that something you would consider or do you really want to see the cash generation drive the debt pay down?\nDerek Kerr: It is something we consider as we look out to planning for 2021 and see where our cash needs are. But it's something we would consider.\nJoe Caiado: And then just one more quick one. Did we say that there is retrofit in aircraft mod activity taking place today as part of the fleet harmonization initiative, so that stuff is no longer on hold? Is that right?\nDerek Kerr: Correct. Yes, for us we had not put it on hold. When I talked about our CapEx being what it is in 2021, almost 40% of that is actually that project. We've continued to push it. With aircraft on the ground we've been able to speed it up, which I think is the right decision to get the 738s done as quick as possible and the 737s -- sorry the 7378s get done as quick as possible and then speeding up the A321s to get that project done. While the aircraft are on the ground we can speed it up, save costs and get the benefits sooner. So those have been in the numbers and remain in the numbers as we move forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So you obviously have some improvement in the cash burn level here into the fourth quarter. Another way to say $25 million to $30 million a day is $10 billion annually, which is still a pretty big number. So maybe going back to Jamie's cost questions, all of the OpEx savings that you've realized, how much of that run rate is being reflected here in the fourth quarter? And if it's simply timing, absent revenue recovery which we can model, where would that kind of $10 billion a year kind of cash burn go to based on the cash savings you've realized?\nDerek Kerr: Well, the way -- we've said we had $17 billion of savings throughout the year, and the $16.2 million of that $1 billion is expense. Now some of that is volume. So as we add volume back in, those expenses are going to go back in. Some of the permanent stuff is what we talked about, which is the management headcount, the efficiencies, the fleet, a lot of the stuff we're doing will be permanent as we move forward to reduce that. What we have all said is that to get us back to cash positive, the cash burn to be breakeven needs -- we've all said it's a demand recovery and we need the demand to come back. So we are holding flat expenses third quarter over fourth quarter. Everything as we add back in capacity, so being more efficient, but the burn difference is coming from the revenue recovery. And where we're seeing it exactly today is what we've modeled out as we go out into the fourth quarter. So I think as we look into next year and as we look forward that it's the demand recovery that gets us back flying our entire fleet, getting the revenue back and being as efficient as we can to cut those costs out in 2021.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just for a follow-up there. This morning on the CNBC interview, I think it was mentioned that there's nothing more -- we've done virtually everything we can on costs at this point. I guess my question would be, are you at a structural disadvantage for some reason? Or what would you need to see in terms of this recovery for that view to change? Thanks for taking the questions.\nDoug Parker: Yes, again, what I said, look, we haven't done anything we cannot -- we haven't got all the cost we can. By now, we sure have showed out. So as you've heard, I think from all the airlines right now, that's where we've gotten to. We've reduced all the costs we can at this point. Clearly, as we ramp back up, as Derek and others have already said, we don't expect you should see the same kind of cost rate going forward. But your question is, of the fourth quarter estimate of 25, 30 cash burn number, how does that get better? We don't want to get the impression that it's going to get a lot better because we're going to further be able to reduce cost for the existing cost levels. Just as our other large competitors, these cash burn numbers are virtually exactly the same in the fourth quarter, aren't going to be doing anything about it. Those numbers will get better for all of us at similar rates as demand recovers. And that is what's required. If it doesn't, we all stay at these kind of burn rates. I don't think anyone expects that to be the case. It hasn't been the case through this year or anything close to it. So we've gotten the improvement in these burn levels from the third to the fourth quarter -- there's some of that is cost savings because we get to sort of furloughs. But by far, our biggest driver is revenue improvement and that's what will be the improvement as we go forward and if we will get this industry back to being cash positive again.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Didora: As Derek maybe told -- to ask Duane's question a little differently on costs, maybe put it on the revenue side. So what level of revenues versus 2019 do you feel like you need to be at in order to reach cash breakeven?\nDerek Kerr: I mean, we've said from a revenue perspective, we building the airline back up and getting it where we\u2019ve got our aircraft back in and we get loads in about 65% to 75% -- 70% range it's kind of where it's going to take to get us back to breakeven. And that -- getting all aircraft back in is capacity much lower than where we were in 2019, because we've taken out 157 aircraft, and it will be much lower than what we had planned. So we're all going to take capacity out in 2021. The industry will be smaller. But getting most of our aircraft back up, getting loads in the 65 to 70 range, which will drive the revenue recovery and get the revenue back in is kind of where we see where we would be breakeven from a cash perspective.\nAndrew Didora: And then just my second question maybe for Vasu. Can you maybe just talk about how your discussions have gone with global authorities and how you're thinking about potentially the reintroduction of the long-haul international network. Maybe what regions or kind of routes do you think could come first, particularly when you think about your new -- how your new fleet plan plays into all of this? Thanks.\nVasu Raja: And so we mentioned earlier, we are actively working with a number of global regulatory bodies, no more so than with the UK seeing really our largest international connect point is indeed our hub in Heathrow. So between ourselves and IAG, we are closely working with the UK government to really create an air travel corridor, which could be not just the basis for further reopening in long-haul services to the UK but indeed the template for how we can do long-haul reopenings more globally. Now other than that, while that impacts primarily our European to some degree our Asian network, really in many ways our South America network is already coming back. Most all of our Miami to South American schedule is in place and doing quite well. And by the time we get into December that will continue. So a big part of our long-haul network, which is South America, we expect to be back certainly by new years or so. And then the other big chunk of it, which is Heathrow we are working on to reopen. And then we have some confidence, it's good for the global aviation community but more critically it\u2019s good for customers everywhere to figure out a really smart way to get a market reopened and that can be a template for doing it elsewhere. So that's how we're thinking about it.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our Analyst Q&A [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal. Your line is now open.\nAlison Sider: Just curious how you're thinking about sort of changes in the competitive landscape seeing some of your competitors starting to announce plans to go into new cities, including some of your hubs, Chicago and Miami. Just curious how you\u2019re seeing that playing out and how you all respond?\nRobert Isom: We welcome the competition. We've got incredibly strong network as we\u2019ve talked on the call today and assets that will serve our customers really well. So look we're excited about the potential for return of demand and we can do when it does come back, and we're ready to take on competition no matter where it comes.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Your line is now open.\nLeslie Josephs: Just want to ask about the advantage program. Do you have any sense of where revenue is going? Is it recovering? And what's your outlook for co-brand card spend going forward, maybe even in 2021?\nVasu Raja: We are indeed -- there is so much has changed in our business such as say the crises. Indeed our co-brand program has -- our revenues haven\u2019t fallen nearly at the rate of overall passenger revenue, simply because people continue to keep spending out there. Indeed, as we look at consumers more broadly, savings are up, people are spending, they're spending on different things. And so, we were actually -- one of our major priorities in the year and years ahead is to work even more closely with our co-brand providers, Citi, Barclays but even MasterCard as well, to ensure that our card is on top of mind and they're are driving increasing amount of spend for our customers and revenue for the Airlines.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Koenig of Associated Press. Your line is now open.\nDavid Koenig: Can you discuss Thanksgiving, Christmas bookings and what kind of look back you are expecting for those holidays? And also to clarify, Derek. Derek are you saying 65 to 70 load factors of breakeven even with the current mix of business and leisure being heavily in leisure?\nVasu Raja: This is Vasu, and I can answer both, so the second one first. Really the simple way to think of it is maybe 65% to 70% of 2019 revenues, which Derek was giving you is holding our yield comps and think about load factors. So that's really the simpler way to think about your second question. And then to your first question, yes, we do anticipate that the Thanksgiving period and the December second half period will be relatively stronger, one, because we have seen the last several holidays, Columbus Day, Labor Day, July 4th and Memorial Day, become sequentially stronger. And indeed, what we're finding more and more is that, as consumers start resuming life, returning to spending in full service restaurants, going back-to-school, things like that, shortly thereafter searches resume and air travel spending resumes too. And even with current rates of case growth, we continue to see that at least in many geographies which is the Sunbelt that are most critical for American Airlines. So we do see that as we get into the Thanksgiving week as Robert mentioned in his opening comments, more than half of our flights are being yield managed in some ways, which means that the airline is holding out anticipating higher revenues closer to departure. And so that's a promising thing, which we hadn't seen in the past. Now this is a volatile environment, the recovery will be choppy and shifting change will respond accordingly. But right now things are better than they were but far from sustainable.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Bachman of Bloomberg. Your line is now open.\nJustin Bachman: I want to know if you could clarify a bit on the timing around the 737 Max deferrals that you announced. As far as what really is your thinking that sales will come? And are you thinking about any other aircraft deferrals if the business is not returning as you're hoping? Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: The deferrals we have 18 deliveries in 2021 and we have deferral rights on eight of those aircraft. And then we had deferral rights on all 10 aircraft that come in 2022. We'll make those decisions down the road as we look at the demand environment as they come back. Those can push to 2023 and 2024. So that's where we're at on those. We have also been working with Airbus on just making and respreading the delivery stream there. We have moved some of the ones that were coming in 2021 to 2022. So we've pushed a little bit. And at this point in time, we're pretty firm on where we are from the delivery schedule with Airbus and Boeing.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Edward Russell of TPG. Your line is now open.\nEdward Russell: I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the Max return to service, there were some reports earlier this week that you'll be flying it around the Christmas time, but I know those dates have slipped repeatedly. How confident are you about that return timeline?\nUnidentified Company Representative: It really just depends on what happens. The aircraft is going to be returned and ungrounded when the FAA says it's okay, and after we and our team gets to take a look at it as well. Based on what we're hearing that would allow for an ungrounding sometime in the month of November. If that holds true, we\u2019ll likely have the aircraft up in service a month or so after that. So potentially by the very end of December. But it all remains to be seen and we're incredibly flexible in terms of any type of time, it's just as we have done over the last -- over the course of the last year or so.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Arnold of Dallas Morning News. Your line is now open.\nKyle Arnold: I know that Chicago and New York, New Jersey, Connecticut expanded some of their travel quarantines. How problematic are the travel here domestically? And is there anything to be done that can stimulate travel in those areas on the west coast and the Northeast where it's not as strong as some other areas of the country?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Travel will come back when there are things that are open and safe for people to do. Certainly any type of restrictions, quarantine, are not helpful. Again, we're trying to make things easier on customers where there are any type of difficulties, such as the work that we're doing in the Caribbean and the work that we are doing in Hawaii and as was mentioned earlier, the work that we\u2019re trying to do in Europe and especially the UK and trying to open up travel corridors. But the real key for all of this is having things for people to do. One of the things that we have talked about is great indicator restaurants being open is a good indicator of people being able to go to travel to those destinations and it\u2019s just a critical key.\nUnidentified Company Representative: And we\u2019ve worked with many of our partners, with the travel association and travel partners, have regional companies as well, that can make sure that we\u2019re all looking to get our current fleets to bring back tourism. One of the things to reduce confusion with our customers as you quite rightly said, when an area may close and then stop quarantine, et cetera is we have just placed on our aa.com, a site where you could place a new destination and it can tell you what requirements to travel are in place for that space, for that countries is exploitable and this is really helping our customers understand and ease their travel as well and help them with bookings going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude our media Q&A. I will now turn the call back over to Doug Parker for closing comments.\nDoug Parker: Thanks everyone for your interest. And any further questions you can just contact Investor Relations or corporate communication. We appreciate your time. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead.\nDan Cravens: Thanks Sarah. Good morning everyone and welcome to the American Airlines Group second quarter earnings conference call. Joining us on the call this morning, we have Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call for our Q&A session are several of our Senior Executives, including Maya Liebman, Chief Information Officer; Elise Eberwein, EVP of People and Communications; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Vasu Raja, Chief Revenue Officer; and David Seymour, our Chief Operating Officer. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and the actions we\u2019re taking during this pandemic. And Doug will follow with details on our liquidity and cost outlook. After Derek\u2019s comments, we will open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecasts of capacity, fleet plans, and liquidity. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June, 30, 2020. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. The webcast of this call will be also archived on our website. The information that we\u2019re giving you on the call is as of today\u2019s date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us this morning. And at this point, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Dan. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to give some color on the work we're doing to manage the current environment, ensure that we are well positioned when we come out of this crisis. Derek is going to provide an update on our liquidity and cash burn. And then as Dan noted, we have several Executives in the room, including our President Robert Isom and our Chief Revenue Officer Vasu Raja, here to answer any questions you may have. So to begin, I need to acknowledge and applaud the entire America West Airlines team. Thus past the past five months have been more than difficult, and our team has consistently risen to the challenge, taking care of customers and each other, as the stability of the of their own employment remains uncertain. Our team does this and much more each and every day. Say, they're leading this -- leading to this crisis with grace is an understatement of enormous proportions. And we're all humbled by their work ethic and professionalism. Till now the actions we're taking to face the COVID-19, the resulting severe instruction to global demand for air travel. In short, the crisis continues. Our team has done an exceptional job of managing through that crisis, as evidenced by the trends we saw throughout the second quarter. And we're prepared to weather the storm ahead and be in a position to succeed when demand recovers. In the near-term, our actions are centered on three pillars, building up our cash reserves, conserving the cash we do use, and adjusting the way we fly, so that when our customers return to the skies, they can do so with complete confidence, confidence they are safe and they enjoyable to do so. And moreover, we're flying when and where they want to go. So first of on cash, we have the second quarter with $10.2 billion of available liquidity, which included an important net $3.6 billion that we raised during the course of the Capital Markets. We also have a sign term sheet with the U.S. Department of Treasury for an additional $4.75 billion secured loan under the CARES Act. And we expect that loan to close in the third quarter. In addition, we announced this morning two senior secured note transaction with both transactions with Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank, totaling $1.2 million. So, when those transactions are combined with our quarter ending liquidity balance of $10.2 million, we would have a Pro Forma liquidity balance of approximately $16.2 million. And we'll have flexibility to raise more if needed and Derek will talk about that in a few minutes. With regard to conserving cash and our cash burn, our daily cash burn rate for the quarter was around $55 million, which was better than our prior guidance of $70 million per day. We were particularly pleased with the rate of improvements [indiscernible]. That daily burn was nearly $100 million per day in April, then around $56 million in May, and was $30 million for -- per day for the month of June. That improvement was driven by both aggressive cost management which Derek will discuss in more detail and significant revenue growth throughout the period. As to revenue, demand was at its lowest point in April, of course, and we had a remarkably low system load factor of 15% and a remarkably low passenger revenue price at [$1.08]. But as several States began to reopen, we began to see demand increase, particularly in some markets where we had a network advantage. So, with some aircraft ownership and labor costs we made a tactical decision to file a larger schedule than some of our competitors, competitors then keeping our large connecting hubs in Dallas/Fort Worth in Charlotte larger than the rest of our network. So anymore that larger schedule we saw increasing loads and unit revenues across the system. Our load factors jumped from 15% in April to 45% in May, and 64% in June. And our passenger revenue per ASM increased from that [$1.08] in April to [$6.09] in May and [$10.03] in June. How's the DFW in Charlotte performed particularly well, with 80% of our flights operating in over 60% load factors throughout the month of June? Now this rate of approval is going to slow as we head into a seasonally softer travel season. And certainly as demand growth is planned sort of late due to increasing infection rates and State and City quarantine restrictions. We've modified our schedules accordingly. And we now expect our third quarter system capacity to be down approximately 60% year-over-year. As to cash burn trends, we expect our third quarter burn rates to be well below our second quarter rates and our fourth quarter rates to be lower than the third. Our goal is to be cash positive in 2021, as demand for air travel gradually improves. Regarding liquidity, we expect in the third quarter of approximately $13 billion and that assumes no additional financing activity in addition to -- other than those transactions I already mentioned. As to restoring cost of consumer demand. One of the best things we can do during this crisis is to put our energy toward winning customer confidence. To that end, we've established a travel Health Advisory Panel comprised of internal leaders from our operations teams, and outside experts to advise us on health and cleaning matters throughout our operation. We've also started working with the global Bio Risk Advisory Council on Accreditation for the cleaning and disinfection practices for our aircraft [air landings]. These steps along with more generous change fee waivers and rebooking opportunities for full flights had helped our customers feel good about flying and feel very good about choosing America. Looking outlook, we're building an even more robust network for our customers. Last week, we announced a new partnership with JetBlue that will provide seamless connectivity for travelers in the Northeast, and create more choice for customers across our complimentary domestic international network. The JetBlue partnership and the West Coast alliance with Alaska that we announced earlier this year will further strengthen our network and will help to ensure we're positioned for success over the long-term. So as good as we feel that our management is in this pandemic and our prospects for future success, we feel terribly about the impact it's having on much of our team. We know we will be a smaller airline going forward. But we've worked to right size all aspects of the organization to that reality. Approximately [5,100] management and support staff positions were eliminated this summer, in a manner consistent with the CARES Act. And last week, we sent warn letters to 25,000 American Airlines frontline team members. We're doing everything we can to mitigate the impacts and by working with our union partners, we put forward new voluntary leave and early out programs for our frontline team. There's also an effort underway by our union partners to extend the current payroll support program into 2021. We're proud to support this union led initiative as we believe our entire industry has a shared goal of keeping hard working frontline team members [indiscernible]. With that, I\u2019ll turn over to Derek who will give more detail on liquidity and cash burn. Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Doug and good morning everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I would also like to thank our entire team and acknowledge what they have endured in recent months. Their continued professionalism toward our customers and fellow team members is a model for all of us, and we are proud to serve alongside them. We reported a GAAP net loss of $2.1 billion or $4.82 per share in the second quarter. And during the second quarter, we did recognize $1.7 billion of pre-tax net special items primarily a $2 billion credit resulting from the payroll support program financial assistance. Excluding those net special items, we reported a net loss of $3.4 billion or $7.82 per share. With this historic decline in the -- in passenger demand, our primary focus has been to ensure we have sufficient liquidity to make it through a weak recovery. We have moved quickly to raise incremental liquidity and reduced our cash burn. We have also taken steps to drive efficiencies in our operation by further accelerating our fleet simplification plan and aligning our cost structure to the new world we find ourselves in. We will continue to leverage the flexibility we have in our scheduling process, and we'll let demand serve as a guidepost for our future capacity levels. We will continue to be relentless in identifying additional ways to improve our cash burn rate going forward. As far as the fleet, as we announced in April, our fleet simplification plan went into high gear during the quarter as we officially retired the Embraer 190s, Boeing 757s, Boeing 767s, and Airbus A330-300 aircraft as well as a number of regional jets. In addition, we put the Atria 3200s and several of our older Boeing 737s into temporary storage programs. These changes have reduced our active fleet count by more than 150 aircraft and accelerated our fleet simplification strategy. Removing these aircraft will also have a material impact on our cost structure going forward, as it means we will avoid significant future maintenance expense, future training costs and future aircraft sparing costs associated with operating a more fragmented fleet mix. These changes alone are expected to bring about significant fleet related maintenance savings to the P&L through 2021. On the expense front, we have taken a fresh look at how our -- how we budget the airline and have taken a zero based approach to our planning for the remainder of 2020 and 2021. These actions have reduced our estimated 2020 operating and capital expenditures by more than $15 billion. Beyond the fuel and environment related savings that were achieved through our capacity reductions we have removed or deferred non-essential expenses throughout the business. We have had great success with our voluntary leave and early out programs, with more than 41,000 employees stepping up to help by opting into a leave or early retirement. And as Doug mentioned earlier, we just completed a 30% right sizing of our management and support staff resulting in annual estimated savings of more than a $0.5 billion. Well, this will -- was a difficult process to go through. We are grateful to those who have -- who are leaving the company for the many contributions they have made to our airline. With regard to capital expenditures, we currently have committed financing on nearly all of our 2020 aircraft deliveries and do not intend to take any deliveries without committed financing. Beyond this, we have removed $700 million from our projected non-aircraft capital spending plan in 2020. And that's $200 million more than we announced last quarter, and another $300 million in 2021. We will continue to aggressively pursue other opportunities to conserve working capital. But we are moving quickly to pull down our costs. We are not done and will continue to take the necessary steps to right size our cost structure for the future. Finally, on liquidity, we have moved quickly to reduce our daily cash burn and strengthen our liquidity position. Well, there are several burn rate definitions out there. We define it as the sum of all net cash receipts less all cash disbursements that includes all debt payments and interest payments. But it does exclude the effect of new financings and new aircraft purchases. Using that definition, our second quarter average cash burn rate was approximately $55 million per day, which was down from our original guidance of $70 million per day. And as Doug said, we ended the month of June at $30 million per day. We ended the second quarter with $10.2 billion of liquidity. During the quarter we raised net $3.6 billion through the issuance of $2.5 billion of secured bonds, of which $1 billion was used to refinance our 364-day delayed draw facility, $1.1 billion in equity and $1 billion in convertible bonds. We also raised $360 million in JFK Municipal Bonds, which the net proceeds are in our restricted cash balance until construction spending occurs. Importantly, we do not have any large non-aircraft debt maturities until our $750 million unsecured bonds mature in June 2022. During the quarter we received 90% of our allotted payroll support program funds and we expect to receive the remainder in July. Separately, we have reached initial terms with the Treasury Department for the approximately $4.75 billion secured loan, which we expect to close in the third quarter. In addition, we announced in a separate 8-K issued this morning $1.2 billion of committed financing subject to final documentation and other closing conditions in the form of two senior secured note transactions with Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank. $1 billion of the notes will be secured by a first lien -- first priority lien against the American Airlines brand and related trademarks and IP. And $200 million will be in secured by existing incremental capacity under our [indiscernible] national collateral. The IP notes allow us to incur up to another additional $4 billion of first lien debt using that collateral. We expect this transaction to close in the third quarter. And as Doug mentioned, when these transactions are combined with our quarter ending cash balance of $10.2 billion, we have a Pro Forma liquidity balance of approximately $16.2 billion. The outlook we have raised thus far based on recent appraisals we have approximately $4 billion of unencumbered assets at our disposal. These consist of aircrafts spare parts, equipment and real estate. This number excludes accounts receivable and any additional borrowing capacity under our secured debt or loyalty program beyond the CARES Act loan. This morning we provided an 8-K, which included an update on our collateral position as detailed in that filing. While we are happy these transactions have improved our liquidity position, we recognize they have come at a cost of increasing the debt load of the company and diluting our shareholders. However, it is important to note that even after these transactions our weighted average cost of debt is slightly above 4%. Investors should know that we did not take these steps lightly and improving our balance sheet as our imperative once we get through this pandemic. As for future cash burn, given that recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, and new quarantine restrictions in some areas, we have adjusted our revenue recovery forecast accordingly. Based on our current forecasts, we expect the third quarter will with -- to end the third quarter with approximately $13 billion of available liquidity assuming no other financing activity in addition to those I've mentioned already. The team has done an incredible job of reducing costs in this environment and shutting down all discretionary spending. As we have said previously, our goal is to get our daily cash burn rate to zero as quickly as possible so that we don't burn cash in 2021. However, the timing of reaching this goal will be greatly impacted by the demand recovery timeline, as the benefits from the majority of the cost cut have already been realized. In summary, it's very -- in a very short period of time, we've taken swift action to bolster our liquidity manager near-term maturities and capital requirements, and fortify our balance sheet to withstand what may be a protracted recovery. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Doug for closing comments before we take questions.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Derek. Before we get to questions, mistakenly think the America West team as [indiscernible] instead of the entire American Airlines team that's clearly 40 on this crisis certainly feels like the old American West days at that times. Hey, Derek thanks to the entire team, of course. And on that note, before we get to questions, I do want to again acknowledge the amazing work of our team. Although we certainly did not none of us could foresee a pandemic like this. The fact is, here we are living that exact reality. And if a pandemic wasn't enough to test our mettle, we've also experienced the sad and stark reality of how far we have yet to go in this country and our quest for inclusion and equality. This summer, we along with the rest of the world, have seen the brutal murders of our fellow citizens and brought to light the reality and persistence of systemic racism in our country. In the wake up the passing of our friends, Civil Rights Leader Congressman John Lewis, is fitting to State clearly once again, black lives matter. While all of us have a responsibility to create a better world for our black neighbors, coworkers, friends and fellow citizens, I can assure you that in American Airlines we stand proud and ready to do our part to support and lead in the areas of diversity, equity and inclusion. On that note, operator, we are ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker: Thank you very much operator. Hi, Doug.\nDoug Parker: Hi, Helane. You remember the America West Day?\nHelane Becker: I do. So, I remember a lot Doug just a lot. So, okay, this is not something to laugh over because we are experiencing something really horrible. In our industry, something I thought honestly, between now and retirement, I would never see again. And so I'm going to kind of be a jerk and I ask this question. You have a lot of aircraft debt on the balance sheet. Because -- and obviously, you have to be a smaller airline for some period of time until we recover [cholesterol] level. So, does it make sense to figure out a way to return those aircraft or somehow figure out a way to get out from under this $50 billion in debt that you have on the balance sheet that at some point has to be repaid?\nDoug Parker: I'm sure, I'll start Helane. You're not being a jerk at all. It's a fair question. We -- as you know, we built up a good bit of debt on the balance sheet as we as we modernize our fleets. The good news is we do have the most modern fleet industry and we don't need to continue do that work? We're happy with the fleet air we've used this opportunity to accelerate the retirement of a lot of our older aircraft, which will make us even more efficient as we emerge in this crisis. We believe the aircraft that we have remaining in our fleet is about the right size or the network, we're going to need as we move, into 2021. If indeed that was not -- turns out not to be the case. We will adjust accordingly of course, but it's that more about the right size of the network as opposed to the debt levels. The answer the debt levels is to get the airline to be cash positive. As I said again, our goal is to do in 2021. And to use all the cash we generate to reduce the debt level, which we will do over time. All of us have increased our debt burden to this crisis to fund the losses and you're right method was higher than the others. I would note, first half, we do have the maturity profile is in our favor, at least as relates to the crisis. As Derek stated, we don't have other than $750 million term loans due in the middle of 2022 is our next large non-aircraft in debt payment, which helps of course. As to what it's done to -- as opposed to a recession, obviously, increasing interest expense. As we look at our interest expense in 2021, at least right now. The interest expenses would be about $300 million higher than what we spent interest expense in 2019. Aircraft debt I think a couple of hundred million more so total, $500 million of additional expense. That's, that's certainly not something we like, but the reduction in management specialist headcounts we talked about saving is more than that. And on top of that all the other efficiencies that Derek talked about add savings in addition to that. So, we are highly confident that as demand returns and as we return to taking care of customers we will be able to service the debt reduce the debt load as we as we go forward as we intended it.\nHelane Becker: Can you just say why interest expense declined in the quarter without net interest expense number Derek maybe?\nDerek Kerr: In the quarter?\nDoug Parker: Sequentially or year-over-year.\nHelane Becker: No, year-over-year?\nDerek Kerr: Yes, I'll look Helane, but I don't see it, it's got to be interest rates going down in our variable debt is over 60%, 70% of our debt so it's got to be driven by that.\nHelane Becker: All right, that makes sense. All right. Well, thanks and thanks, Doug, for that very detailed answer. I really appreciate it.\nDoug Parker: Thank you Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning, guys. So, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the sequential trends kind of into the third quarter and the back half of the year, if we're going from, the $100 million a day to $30 million a day. Should we expect that number to continue to come down sort of at a steady state level of demand? I guess, I'm trying to figure out, what level of impact the actions you've taken would have as their fully implemented and run through the P&L. So, if you give us some color on the trajectory of that burn rate at a constant demand level that would be helpful?\nDoug Parker: Yes, Vernon. We tried I think in our comments that much of the -- as Derek said, the cost reductions are largely in place. And there's some that occurs into the third and fourth quarter. And then certainly with the October 1 day we are -- we have the ability to reduce our labor costs, somewhat -- those are enormous numbers in terms of daily cash burn, that\u2019s a kind of $3 million or $4 million a day [exact] numbers on that. The bulk of what would be required to get to improvement is demand improvement. So, what we've said again was that we expect the sequential improvement in the third quarter, fourth quarter \u2013 third quarter and then our fourth quarter the third quarter and then into 2021 to be have a goal of being cash positive. So, but those trends are much more about demand -- gradual demand improvement than they are about cost improvement.\nDerek Kerr: Yes, and David, I mean, just from a cost perspective, we were down 46% in the second quarter, that trended even tighter was 41 in April, 49 in May, 48 in June. So, in that area where we were from a capacity perspective, so that could change just depending on if you add back capacity don't add back capacity. But that's kind of a trend we were running from a cost perspective throughout the second quarter, those will stay -- those will remain and only increased by capacity, because all of the costs have been taken out. And as Doug talked about, there might be another little step function in October depending on where we go from that -- from a cost perspective in October.\nDavid Vernon: All right, thank you.\nDoug Parker: Thanks David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavi Syth: Okay, good morning. Just a little bit more on the cash burn and actually related to the plans for this kind of severance or voluntary severance that you've provided. Just how much of that do you can expect to execute and I think, Doug, you mentioned maybe $3 million to $4 million a day savings, is that how we should look at it? And then if the PSP grant is extended, how does that impact the planning process?\nDerek Kerr: Hey, Savi. Just on the severance, we did not do -- we've spread it out over time period. So, there is no big cash outflow from a severance perspective. So, everybody's getting paid through October timeframe. So, that the number that Doug talked about $2 million to $3 million is pretty good. And, that includes the severance that people get today for that are leaving and any other adjustments that we can do from an efficiency standpoint in the third quarter. So, those are the key as we get into the third quarter, but the severance is that's not a lump sum. It\u2019s spread out over time. That helped?\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And what's -- like what's the savings that you expect and those that can offset them that completely?\nDerek Kerr: That's the $2 million to $3 million we talked about, that is the same.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Okay. So, severance is not much.\nDerek Kerr: Yes.\nSavi Syth: Okay. And then just a follow up to that is like if the PSP grant gets extended, how does that impact the planning process given? I'm guessing this is a something that has happened -- to happen -- has to happen over a couple of months in advance?\nDoug Parker: Yes, I mean, the legislation as proposed by our Unions, just as a simple extension of the PSP program, so the dates change from October 1 to March 31. That would I mean that our commitment to in voluntarily separate anyone would be extended till March 31. And the funds that the -- funds that were allocated in Case 1 of $25 billion to compensate airlines for retaining, for paying our team that would be reallocated. So, you wouldn't have that savings and you'd have funds that come in to offset the savings.\nSavi Syth: Helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes on the line as Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time.\nDoug Parker:\n.:\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, guys. There is a couple of questions on the recent demand downturn, hoping you could help us frame the magnitude of that. Any color on what gross bookings were in June versus July, or just anyway to think about the fall offs we've seen as new cases spike? And then could you just walk us through what actions you are taking to address this weaker demand? Was that third quarter capacity outlook down 60 different a couple weeks ago or maybe there's more downside risk now a couple of there but really to try to get a better sense of the magnitude of the slowdown?\nVasu Raja: Hey, this is Vasu. Thanks for the question. I'll start into that. Look what we're seeing are pretty consistent trends with what you've heard reported, we're seeing right now net bookings down 75% to 80%. This is a market difference from where we were certainly in the month of June and even in May. What American Airlines saw and what we've probably disproportionately benefited from was that a number of States across the Sunbelt started reopening in May and June. With every phase of reopening, we saw steady improvement of net bookings, both among our leisure segments and among the business segments, added probably high watermark is net bookings across the system were down 50% the Sunbelt, they were down, net 35% to 40%. Now we're seeing that down net 75% to 80%. Still our Sunbelt bookings outpaced the rest of the system. As we go forward, we anticipate many of those trends to continue. We see really a minimal -- really a token amount of business travel out there and not a lot of indicators that that's likely to improve. So unsurprisingly we're -- here we\u2019re building the airlines capacity around that that demand projection, so, you see us taking down Q3 more and we're continuing to evaluate Q4 and beyond.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, understood. And then maybe just a question on the cash burn outlook. If I just take your second quarter liquidity adjusts out to new $6 billion in debt rates including everything announced this morning to get that $13 billion expected third quarter and liquidity, that gets me to about $35 million daily burn, I guess maybe a little bit north of that, if I include the -- that last 10% of the PSP funds. I guess, first, am I missing anything in that math? And then can you walk us through what type of revenue assumptions are underlying that? And then, to get to fourth quarter being lower than that what kind of revenue assumption or improvement we have to see to drive that lower? Thanks, appreciate the time guys.\nDoug Parker: Sure, [indiscernible]. Never on the matter and just please note that those are the in number is approximate. So, we want to try to imply a certain level of precision around that number that you should put precise numbers on these daily cash burn numbers. But so I think -- I'm sure you did the math right. We have very limited demand growth in that $13 billion quarter end number, so not much at all and in our -- real -- much increase in the fourth quarter not really consistent with all of us we just described. So anyway, we at our conservative as it relates to demand. And as we said on the expenses where it is I'll just give a little commentary on these just these daily cash burn numbers, but which I know are important to our investors. They vary so much certainly by month and therefore by quarter sometimes, we need to be careful about looking at those as real trends as long as you understand that. And as far as you understand how they compare to others and all others exclude different things than we do. It's not a GAAP measure. I know we also have important measure that's why we give you a quarter ended estimated liquidity balance but less. But we try to have less focus on that actual number, because there's just so much variability around it.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Thanks appreciate that.\nDoug Parker: Thank you Catherine.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is not open.\nDoug Parker: Hey, Mike.\nMike Linenberg: Hey. Hey, Doug. Hey, everyone. Thanks. Good morning. I guess two quick ones here. Derek, I know that I believe under the CARES Act, we can defer social security taxes, I guess the portion this year. I think you can defer your minimum pension contribution. I think there's some benefit on payroll. Do you have a sense of how that maybe collectively those other various initiatives that we don't spend too much time on, but how much that could boost your liquidity in 2020?\nDerek Kerr: Yes, on the one item, I know for sure on the pension side of things, we do have to make a pension payment on January 1, which is a holiday. So, we ended up having to do it on December 31. So, there's not a -- it's not a zero number in 2020. But, we had originally thought it would be around 500 now it's down to 140. So, there's a significant savings there. The -- we have gotten some tax refunds in the $170 million range which have been positive and one of them is $85 million, we're getting this quarter in the third quarter. And then the deferral of those other taxes, we have them all in 2021 anyway so that you're going have to pay them back in 2021. So, the net impact over \u201820 and \u201821 is zero.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then just my second question, really to Vasu. Look, you announced the JetBlue recently, the JetBlue agreement recently, and it seems very similar to what you announced with Alaska back in February. And I realized it's a really tough backdrop to start noticing any sort of benefits from the Alaska deal, I guess, since it is initially only up and running in a few months. Is there anything that you can tell us with respect to maybe quick wins and things that you've seen as you started to work more closely with Alaska that you think will materialize will materialize with under the JetBlue agreement? Thank you.\nVasu Raja: Yes. Yes, thanks for the question, Mike. I'm happy to do it. In fact, let me put my answer in some context here. That -- in American Airlines we have sort of a unique problems we look all across our hubs. Our hubs excluding the Northeast that is New York and Boston and the West Coast produce unit revenue premiums of 10% to 12% higher than the industry, indeed has grown since the time of our mergers, we've up gage rebuilt the regional network, improved connectivity and grown in Dallas/Fort Worth. In the Northeast and the West Coast, however, we produce a 10% [rather] deficit to the industry. This is important because about 22% to 23% of our 2019 capacity is deployed on the West Coast and the Northeast, put that in perspective about DFW in 2019 was about 26%, 27% of the airline, Charlotte was about 12% to 13% of the airline. So we have a material amount of our capacity in these markets in both of these cases but the West Coast and the Northeast infrastructure is constrained. And we're in a situation where we're really too small to win and too big to go and exit. And so we need to figure out a way and it\u2019s just such a massive customer base that we need to find a way to go and access that revenue. So in our partnerships both with Alaska and JetBlue what it is entirely about is creating different and creative, competitive alternatives to the larger networks that our competitors offer on those coast. And that's what that was exactly what you see us doing. So, we continue to go and build our Seattle hub and together with Alaska, we will go and create the best of the network on the West Coast with JetBlue. American Airlines is historically and New York State a great case study for this. Historically, we have a 10% originating share in the largest air travel market in the world. We operate 50 seat jets and some of the most expensive aircrafts and expensive airports in the world. And so by doing this, we leverage the strength of both of these companies. The play here is very much that if we can do this, we go and attract more customers to have our joined up networks, financially that of course rectifies, the very massive revenue problem that we have across our hub system, it creates a really pro competitive outcome. And very importantly, it keeps these really vibrant and independent competitors, vibrant independent competitors. So, we are really keen about all of them, the big onus is on us to go and execute make these partnerships as seamless as possible. And we're working very ordinately at that. Indeed, today we're announcing Alaska's formal invitation into one world that will really accelerate the process. And we're envisioning by the end of this year for worst case. Early 2021, we'll have them as a full-fledged member. And we are eager to go and progress the integration with JetBlue as well.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thanks, Vasu. Thanks for the detail.\nVasu Raja: Yes.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes on the line of Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. I guess this means I'll wrap up the cactus triumvirate. David, Helane and Mike have already opined. Derek, can you walk through how the brand in the website is worth enough to support up to $5 billion of additional first lien debt? Excuse me when loyalty is already pledged elsewhere? I mean, those are pretty material figures. And we don't think that most investors had those in their liquidity models prior to today's disclosures.\nDerek Kerr: Right. So, I mean we have an appraisal on both of the transactions. I mean, as we went into this process, as you know we ran appraisals on everything, because we needed to do that as we were looking at the government loan and what we wanted to do with a government loan, so we ran an appraisal just on the frequent flyer program and then we separated out everything else and put it into the brand discussion, I would say. The value of that is -- it depends on where the value is, but somewhere in the $10 billion range, whereas the frequent flyer program, as we've announced before is somewhere in the $20 billion range. So we've done appraisals on both, that is a transaction we've been working on for a little bit this recent one. And as we negotiate it got ourselves the ability to do an extra $4 billion underneath that transaction and it's held up by an appraisal that that we've that we've done.\nJamie Baker: And in regards to a potential Ford Mileage sale, are you -- have you reached a conclusion with Treasury yet that they you could speak to that potential phenomenon?\nDerek Kerr: We have not reached the conclusion -- we have not reached a conclusion with Treasury yet. We're still working with Treasury on the trans on the $4.75 billion transaction and where we will go there. But I think it's, as we've seen, it is not a Ford Mileage transaction on top of that as you know our competitor was very successful and did a really nice transaction to take their frequent flyer program and take it to the market that is available. It probably would take us a little bit of time to do that, just because our company is our, our frequent flyer program is not set up as a separate company, which our competitors was for them the ability to do that transaction. So that ability is there they you mean we're at $4.75 billion we have a bigger program and I think they raised $6.8 billion $6.9 billion against it. So, I think in the future, that transaction is there. It's not there today for us, but it is there in the future. So, if we cannot utilize the room underneath the government loan that transaction is available in the future.\nJamie Baker: And if I can just squeeze a short third one in. On JetBlue, can you just remind us what you can and can't do in regards to the partnership? What level of coordination pricing scheduling is legally permissible?\nVasu Raja: Yes, I can\u2019t. Thanks for the question, Jamie. The way we've envisioned it, it would be really a pretty broad partnership, where of course, we would have extensive code sharing back and forth, frequent flyer benefits and a big amount of corporate dealing. A big part of what makes this go certainly as we look at it something that we think will be great for customers back came into, we envision being able to take out things like 50 seat regional jets, which are on a many ways really uncompetitive product and a place like New York or Boston and arrange a number of slot moves within JFK and LaGuardia such that certainly and we can grow its mainline presence. That's where you see us adding more long haul services in New York. And indeed, over time we anticipate being able to do a whole lot more of that. And then, of course also for our new partner JetBlue, they also get to go and expand. So, in doing that, we see a lot of ways that we can get work together that may be a little unconventional from traditional co-shares in the past that can create a huge benefit for our customers A very big benefit to our team and can help both of these airlines really participate in the recovery as in what happens.\nJamie Baker: Thanks, gentlemen.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.\nDaniel McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Just following up on that, that the alliance with JetBlue and Alaska, Vasu I guess if I heard correctly, it's 23% of the flying in 2019 is the goal to get that back pay industry parity really think you can get up with these alliances get to a premium and I guess kind of where I'm going this for investors as they think about 23% of the fine. Is this, revenues that could improve 10% across 23% of the fine if we get back to parity?\nVasu Raja: Yes, that's an excellent question, Dan. And sound way to think of the problem. Yes, look at it to clarify the numbers, in 2019 about 22%, 23% of our capacity base was on the West Coast New York, Boston, right compare that to our two strongest performing markets of DFW and Charlotte, which collectively represented about 48%, 49% of the airline. So, there's a material amount of capacity that and for a long time has been producing [TRASM] below the industry average. Now, in the perfect back half of 2019, I think a lot of the way you describe that makes sense. The open question is, how the world recovered and how quickly we can achieve steady state. But for that reason, these partnerships are all the more critical to be able to be done now, because the reality is left to everyone's own devices, the third and fourth largest carriers in New York just won't be able to compete for a New York for a diminished New York originating premium customer given the current demand outlook that's there. So by having this maybe a little bit of time before we're able to we\u2019ve achieve some of the financial goals that we want from this thing. But for us, as long as we are doing what is right by the customer in New York and Boston, providing real competition to the larger networks that we face there. There's a real path for how we go about doing it. And as you say, there's probably a lot of upside through this thing that we envision being able to go. And certainly scale the massive fixed expenses of operating in a place like New York over things like wide bodies instead of over things like 50 seat regional jets. So we think that there is a lot of long-term economic benefits there. The current crisis that the pandemic creates the uncertainty and demand makes it a little bit of an uncertain path for how we go from here to there. But the core way in which you're thinking about it is similar to how we think about.\nDaniel McKenzie: Very good. I guess the follow up question here. Doug, going back to your commentary this morning, on CNBC to generate cash next year and start paying down debt or maybe this is for Derek, based on what you see and today and what's in the business plan can you give us a balance sheet roadmap from here, what, what's the range of debt you would aspiration layer could prepay next year? And what do you want the balance sheet to look like realistically at the end of next year and then as we look three years down the road?\nDoug Parker: I'll start and Derek will give more specifics, I'll let him. But it's really hard to give any sort of targets at this point into 2021 and 2022 and beyond with any sort of specificity, and so it's so much dependent upon what happens with return to demand with managed return. What I know is that as again, we have a goal of being cash -- getting ourselves cash positive in 2021. That certainly requires some demand growth, but we don't think unreasonable demand growth. And we believe we can do that as that happens and as there's more stability, first, as that happens, we will definitely be using all free cash to retire our free cash flow to retire that and as we have more certainty as to what the economic environment looks like going forward, we can give you better indications of kind of calls on debt levels and credit ratios going forward. It's going to be hard for us to do on this call.\nDerek Kerr: Yes, and Dan, I'll give you a little bit I mean, just we part of the debt that we took on as a revolver obviously a 2.8. So, as the as the cash balance works out, we would return the revolver. As you know, the CARES Act loan and the PSP loan, which combined our $6.4 billion are pre payable at any point in time. We have pre payable aircraft mortgages of $3.1 billion, and our SGRs are pre payable, we can pay down in a point in time. So, we have $17 billion to $20 billion that is as long as we get the liquidity and get the cash that we could use that to pay-off the debt that's there. First thing we would do is a revolver and we would just return the revolver when we're comfortable and that's about $2.8 billion of the debt.\nDaniel McKenzie: Very good. Thanks, you guys.\nDoug Parker: Thanks Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Kay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDoug Parker: Good morning.\nHunter Kay: Hey, Doug, Derek. Just briefly what is the -- what is your three year vision for American Airlines?\nDoug Parker: Well, I guess it's going to be kind of like what at this point in time now describing what the next three years looks like is not the easiest thing to do. But sitting here right now to get first I'd like I can get to the first one pretty easy which was getting through this crisis and continuing this airline back to where we're generating cash. So, we're talking about burning cash. So, that I know we can do, look they'll pay you this one and it may be helpful. As horrible as this crisis is and there's not much because you can say about one nice one thing. The one opportunity it's given us which I think is more helpful to us than others. We American and then we cover. And it gave us a chance, post integration to literally start to take the largest airline in the world and start to and shut it down and start it from scratch. That's a real opportunity that we're using. That allows us to only add back what makes sense. Things that might have taken us a very long time to continue to get through in getting manage our reductions and giving over every time getting more efficient throughout the airlines flying exactly where it makes sense. Look at network and say in total it makes sense but some routes not doing as well as others. That's going to make us much more efficient, we come out of that. Out of it, we're excited about that. So, we're going to add back only what makes sense. We'll come through it more efficiently. That looking forward to that day, when we're through all this and we can and we have that advantage. So, that has been helpful to us, and again something that I guess say probably because we had more need to do that coming still through integration. And that gives us more opportunity to do that. So, anyway as it relates because of that. Once we get to a more steady state environment, what I think you'll see from American is or is relative to our competitors, our relative performance will be improved. And as the industry improves, we will endeavor to what's reaching to pay down the debt we've had we've all had to incur to fund these lines.\nHunter Kay: Okay, thanks. And then, just my second question, just three very specific ones. Can you just give me your daily cash burn number for 3Q, what are you expecting for revenue in 3Q and how much you're expecting third quarter operating expense to decline?\nDoug Parker: Yes. Again, I think the guidance we gave was to give you the liquidity numbers the liquidity and additional finance and so you can calculate from that, from the estimated cash burn. I'm sure there you know the other ones --.\nDerek Kerr: While, I think the third quarter cost down is going to be adjusted because with seats shared as we pull the capacity on. So, we ran about 46% in the second quarter down in cost. We believe that we're going to fly, so we fly -- we flew a little bit more in July but we think we're going to pull down August and September. So, I think that it'll be a little bit lower than that but not too far off. So, in the -- if we're at 46 for the quarter, we're probably going to be in the 40, 42 range for that in the third quarter from an expense standpoint. And then from a revenue standpoint, we were at 86% down in the second quarter, maybe 80% in the third quarter, 75% to 80% in the third quarter but it's depending on what we do with capacity in August and September which as Vasu said we're looking at that now and with the buyers to bring it down.\nHunter Kay: Thank you, Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Okay. Next one?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, hi. Good morning. Doug or Robert, I think you all are in the window or nearing the window on when you could renegotiate or start talking to Citi and Barclays about an extension. Can you just talk about their willingness to engage their appetite for the business given the challenges the travel industry is facing. And whether we should assume an improvement in economics even if it's not or the same magnitude as the last contract. But still an improvement in economics if and when you can get a new contract. Thank you.\nRobert Isom: So, just Joe, its Robert. We have the ability to renegotiate in 2020 the contracts come due. We obviously are working, we have been working with both Citi and in Barclays. I could tell you from the work with both partners that there is tremendous interest. We know that the American Airlines, our customer base, and our loyalty program are credible assets to both Barclays and the Citi. We have every intent to continue those relationships and expect a tremendous amount of value to come back to American. Now obviously, the current environment is not the best in which to be talking about increasing values but as we take a look to the stabilization of the business and take a look at the future, I'm quite confident that the economics are going to be equal to and better than what they are today.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you. Then Derek, I think your NOLs are getting bigger. So, you've got back to 140 which is nice. Can you just remind us how that works and then your ability to use those, I think you had some that began to expire in 2023, so just how that works. Thank you.\nDerek Kerr: Yes. I mean, right now we have Federal at 90.1 billion stated about three. We believe we can use them, we're still as we look at forecast out we believe that they will all be used in the ones in 2023 will be used. If not, we will as put up and evaluate each an allowance for them if you look at the forecast and assume that they can be used. But as of right now, with the cash ability and changes we can do, we believe we will use all that point one that we're on prior to prior at the beginning of this year. And that and all will be used by 2023. We've got enough room to be able to use them all.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, thank you.\nDerek Kerr: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent with Citi. Your line is now open.\nStephen Trent: Thank you, everybody. And I appreciate you taking my question. Just curious in terms of your longer-term thinking. What's the view with respect to maintaining New York and Philadelphia hubs and I'm know you're cancelling some international destinations? But just trying to think in terms of how you're thinking about the optimization of those assets?\nVasu Raja: Hi Stephen, this is Vasu, thanks for the question. We're additionally keeping both the Philadelphia and the New York hub. And we've seen this before. Look what when we put the merger together, there is a lot of worry that DFW Charlotte and the DFW Phoenix which are overlapping and contradictory purposes. Indeed, as we grown anyone, we've seen the RASM performance of all of them grow by having multiple how does it that have similar purposes you can go in and create a lot of value for the customer. And we see the same footprint not just with New York and Philadelphia but the three hubs at New York, London and Philadelphia. That we're going to go into a world where international is going to have a much longer recovery path. And frankly, American Airline already was producing less than industry RASMs in international. So, we envision Philadelphia as being the primary connecting point. In Philadelphia, we can connect between 90% of the country through there. The low exceptions being New York and Boston and Upstate New York. In New York City, we will focus it very heavily around O&D Markets out in New York and a major connecting market that be it things like Vegas, Orlando, things like that. And in London, we have a great market and with our partner IAG the opportunity to go and expand London where we can go provide more current activity not just in the Europe but in the places like Middle East, Africa and India. Between the three, even though we go into a world where demand is more competed, where next year we will be a materially smaller carrier and an extremely smaller carrier internationally. This enables us to go and take a bigger share of what demand is there, provide a maximum amount of connectivity to the customers in the process.\nStephen Trent: Okay, very helpful. Let me leave it there and everybody stay healthy and safe.\nVasu Raja: Thanks, Stephen.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Koenig with The Associated Press. Your line is now open.\nRobert Isom: Hi, David.\nDavid Koenig: There's a guy who used to work at America West and he said yesterday that his current airline specs that revenue is going to rise about 50% of pre-COVID and stay there until there is a vaccine that's widely available. I wondered if Doug, if you agree with that view or if you have a different idea about how the recovery on solds and how you're going to get to even to 50%?\nDoug Parker: Yes. There I know that guy too. And I also know he said it's anyone's guess and now what's your guess. So, it's reasonable, I don\u2019t have any reason to tell you that we disagree with that and certainly kind of what we're planning or is a look forward is consistent with that type of recovery. I don\u2019t think any of us believe that we're going to get anything close to. I mean, the old demand until there is a vaccine, it's widely spread. So, anyway until that point, on that point I hope he's right that once it happens, demand returns quickly.\nDavid Koenig: Or is it, this current wall is just kind of a temporary stall here with the recent surge in cases?\nDoug Parker: Oh yes, there again what we've seen with certain cases we saw some -- we saw what was a continual growth in demand sequentially month-to-month plateau. And so, that certainly happened. And as cases hopefully fall in the future, one would expect that you see what we saw through April, May, and June, as demand recover somewhat. But again, nothing that we would anticipate, really gets back to the kind of demand we talked 2019. And how the country's moving. And I mean, this is the last of our peoples concern about flying and much more about having a reason to travel. And having business open and moving and having places to go when you travel and not needing the quarantine. And as those things happen, more and more people will travel but clearly in some cases all that's not going to happen until we get to a vaccine.\nDavid Koenig: Okay, thank you.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Your line is now open.\nDoug Parker: Hi, Tracy.\nTracy Rucinski: Hi, good morning.\nDoug Parker: Good morning.\nTracy Rucinski: I was wondering what your deals are on how business travel is going to evolve. Do you see any permanent changes?\nVasu Raja: Hey Tracy, this is Vasu. Thanks for the question. Look, it remains to be seen. So, much of what this crisis is, it's not just the demand as well but it's such uncertainty about it. Yes, we do see evolutions that are out there but in many ways we're already seeing as that the customer segmentation is changing a little bit from business and leisure which airlines and historically defined and in different kinds of transactions and much more what customers are keen to regain. So, to resume their economic flights and which customers are less ready to. And often times the differences between those are a function of people's confidence in resuming it and necessity. So, a great example of this is whenever we were in the first week of April which is probably our lowest point for booking small-and-medium sized book -- business bookings out of Texas were almost zero. They were like 10,000 a week which is not even single-digit percentages. By June the 15th, after Texas went through phase III reopening, they had increased 300% to 45,000 or so which is still relatively small but far from -- they are far from where we would like them to be. And that same period corporate books didn\u2019t really change it all. So, it is likely to think that for a period of time, one business bookings as we historically call them is going to be very different and companies are unlikely to go and resume their economic life. So, it's bigger companies. And there is a lot of uncertainty around what and how smaller companies might be. So, we are planning certainly for some very conservative assumption and in many ways is continuing to adapt the airline for the change in customer base had become.\nDoug Parker: Thanks Vasu, thanks Tracy.\nRobert Isom: So, we're ready to go on to next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Your line is now open.\nDoug Parker: Hello, Ali.\nAlison Sider: Hi, good morning. Doug, can you is there anything you can share about sort of how many flights were in terms of capacity what the change will be from July to August? It looks like you're still trying to fly more than some of your peers, is that kind of how you see it?\nVasu Raja: Hi Ali, this is Vasu, thanks for the question, good to speak again. Look, we haven\u2019t finished loading all of that changes in the August or even in the September. And how we load that change is probably going to occur over multiple periods of time. As we've kind of described before, we've changed a lot of our internal processes around is whimsical. In this environment of uncertain demand, we will have to adapt and we have to be flexible. So, we describe ourselves as being nimble or adaptable, it's not using this and we're flying more, it means exactly that. That in the pace of uncertain demand, the airline has to evolve. And so, while we envision viewing really in August you'll see it pretty consistent with our comments on this call that we continue to see our biggest hub DFW and Charlotte building, we anticipate keeping the connectivity there but doing a lot of other adjustments because markets are a much more dependent on business style traffic are likely to not come in. To put a finer point on it, once we cross Labor Day, historically in this airline about 40% of our revenues come up off business and it's pretty unreasonable at this point to think that we'll get anywhere close to that. And so, we really said we're more dependent on business or likely to come out. But rather than making a single blanket call and taking it all at one time, you'll see us make this cut over a period of time. So, we envision really in August where we're still taking bookings that are lot more of our capacity, we'll sit in the biggest hubs than not. And as we mentioned earlier, we'll take some pretty material reductions to what we're out there selling both in the second-half of August and post-Labor Day, such that Q3 capacity will be at a minimum down about 60%.\nAlison Sider: Got it. And yes, just trying to get my mind on how much of this is seasonal, does this have to look sort of never going to come back in the fall and how much of it is sort of a change in thinking about the demand trajectory?\nVasu Raja: Well, what I say there has been definitely some seasonality to it. And really it's not very much of a change of thinking about keeping the airline schedule and operating fact that's really flexible so we can adapt to the change in demand landscape. And that's what we've been doing throughout the crisis, we'll continue to do along the way.\nAlison Sider: Alright, thank you.\nVasu Raja: Thanks, Ali.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Claire Bushey with Financial Times. Your line is now open.\nClaire Bushey: Hey. Have you ever seen the response from the Vice President or the European Commission of the Home Affairs regarding that letter you sent about transatlantic COVID testing and what sort of would this testing regime look like?\nVasu Raja: Hey, this is Vasu. I'm starting with the question. We've and the candid answer is that we are still looking at it and evaluating it, discussing heavily with our partner IAG. And then, so we don\u2019t have a lot of insight yet but in the next few days and weeks we expect it.\nDoug Parker: And we've not had responses yet, just since we went out last week.\nClaire Bushey: Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bachman with Bloomberg L.P. Your line is now open.\nJustin Bachman: Hi, good morning and thanks for the time today. I wanted to ask about there were 12 or so Boeing Max aircraft that you were looking for additional help in financing that would be delivered this year. Do you have any updates on where that stands and if those there planes are coming to American or if you've decided to move on or differ those?\nDerek Kerr: Hey Justin, this is Derek. The plan is to take those aircraft while we're working with Boeing is a firm upset financing and make sure that with the delays in the aircraft that that financing is firm. We are having really good discussions with the Boeing team, working hard, they're a great partner for us. We totally plan on taking those aircraft, there's 13 that are built that haven\u2019t come to us yet and there is another four that are supposed to come by the end of the year; so another 17. So, we're going to Boeing to make sure that those are financed as we said in the comments that we don\u2019t plan on taking any aircraft that are financed. But we're working well and we're also looking at the 21 and 22 aircraft. So, we're not done, we're in we're talking with them and all conversations are good and our plan would be to still take all 100 aircraft we have on order over time and just when we take them is the discussions that we're having. But good discussions, not done yet, will be done pretty soon I think.\nJustin Bachman: So, all of those 17 that you just mentioned, will that be this year or does some of those slip into '21?\nDerek Kerr: We hope all 17 is this year but it all depends on when you when the aircraft is back up in the air and how quick they can get them and deliver them. But we would be okay to have them all this year. Some of them may slip into next year but I would assume by early part of next year they would all be here.\nJustin Bachman: Great, thank you.\nDerek Kerr: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Your line is now open.\nDoug Parker: Hi, Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay, hi good morning everybody. A quick question on the salaries and the labor bill looks like it's down close to 21% compared with last year. Are you going to have any money left over if it kind of continues on that trajectory there we do signed schedules or other revoked leave. And are you can you use the Paris payroll support for severance packages or do you have other plans if that happens, and you do have a left over from the PSP?\nDerek Kerr: We will not have any left over from the PSP. I think the amount of PSP there we received was about 76% of the salary over the second and third quarter. So, there won't be any money left and we can't use that PSP money for severance and other things; that's other cash.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay, thanks.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Leslie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Edward Russell with PPG. Your line is now open.\nEdward Russell: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to add getting your own words. If you think that American strategy deploy more capacity in the second quarter especially in June was worth it and if you just you have to explain why you're thinking behind that?\nDoug Parker: Sure. And I'll start, then Vasu you can chime in. And what this -- we did indeed why more is in my view anyway we're got into somewhat made it to a bigger issue than certainly the way we think of it. This is a tactic in crisis management. As we're all managing through a crisis trying to scale with as individual airlines. I think it's accurate to say that we will twice as much as some other airlines but it's also accurate to say that we put 40% of our prior schedule and other airlines 20% of their prior schedule. And so, the real story there is that we're down 60% and they're down 80%. This is the crisis. We all work to figure out what's best for our airlines. Our network team did a phenomenal job. Seeing that while as we all had pulled down schedules, that connectivity in particular had then reduced throughout the country and that we could by focusing on our DFW and Charlotte hubs have the ability to have more connectivity than others and give us advantage on the limited demand that was there to carry more than we would otherwise. So, that absolutely worked in June as in my comments in our revenue per ASM in June was six times what it was in April. And we that would not have been the case that we found only 20% of our capacity and in many ways of finding more and having that kind of increase in RASMs. We're extremely happy with it. It's worked well into July and we're happy with the results we've seen in July. Our low factors remain high and higher than our competitor airlines even though we're flying more. So, we're really happy with that tactics. It's not going to make a big difference six months from now is we did some and we have others that are trying to be bigger than everyone else over time. It's just a tactic during this crisis which's worked out really well for us. And we're really proud of us and what it sees is network to clients and orders and other came -- it's more just in team with counter strategy to manage the crisis. It's worked really well for us. Anything to add, Vasu?\nVasu Raja: Yes. The only thing I would add to that matter is that as Doug said it did very much work well for us. Simple way to think of it is we have come 60% more than our primary competitors and generated 60% more passenger revenue. So, by any means, being able to have that come in was big and a big part for what our cash burn looks the way it does. But also require finer point on few things that Doug just mentioned. Look, it taught us a lot too along the way as we went through June. Fewer than 2% of our flights were flying below 25% but very too strong with our DFW and Charlotte were 60% at the airline and produced 11 and 12 set RASMs which even in a normal June would be a really good June for many of the airlines all around the world. So, that were very instructive to it and also by flying that big, we got to get a really we have to try a lot of things across the commercial organization that has taught us a lot about how our customer base is evolving and those are all things we're putting into practice. And like Doug said, this was a tactic of managing and it was really a one-time thing that we did knowing that June and July would be months where if there were discretionary leisure travelers, that's the time to get them. And clearly in the fall where the airlines becomes more dependent on business travel that is no longer a planning reality for us. And so, we're adjusting that we're taking the insights we learned along the way with us.\nEdward Russell: Great. Thank you, very much.\nVasu Raja: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker for closing remarks.\nDoug Parker: Thank you very much for your interest and we appreciate if you have any questions, either contact Investor Relations or Cravens. Call the Investor Relations department. We appreciate your time. Thanks, bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

To ask a question during this session, you will need to press star, one on your telephone. If you require any further assistance, please press star, zero. I would now like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead, sir.\nDan Cravens: Thanks Cindy. Good morning everyone and welcome to the American Airlines Group first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us in the room this morning we have Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, our President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call for our Q&A session are several of our senior execs, including Maya Liebman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs, Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management; and Vasu Raja, our Senior VP of Network Planning. The focus of today\u2019s call will be our response to COVID-19. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and the actions we\u2019re taking. Robert will then follow with commentary about our team members, customers and network. Derek will then walk us through the details on our fleet, cost outlook and liquidity. Then after we hear from those comments, we\u2019ll open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecasts of capacity, fleet plans, and liquidity. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found on our earnings release that was issued this morning along with our Form 10-Q as of March 31, 2020. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website.  The webcast of this call will also be archived on our website and the information that we\u2019re giving you on the call is as of today\u2019s date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thanks again for joining us. At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thanks Dan. Good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. Before I get into the numbers, I want to offer a few thoughts on the challenging times that we and our entire industry are facing. The spirit and efforts of the American Airlines team during this crisis have been nothing short of extraordinary. The human and economic toll of COVID-19 has been enormous, and like others, we\u2019ve lost members of our own team and our hearts are heavy for their families, friends and coworkers. In the face of this great loss, the American team continues to rise to the challenge and meet the needs of our customers and the communities we serve. They\u2019re putting on their uniforms every day and transporting first responders to where they\u2019re most needed, and other Americans to where they feel most safe. Our team members are frontline heroes in this battle and they are what makes America great. On behalf of the entire leadership team, I want to thank our team for what they continue to do every day. Turning to this quarter\u2019s results, by far the most important recent event for our industry\u2019s long term viability has been the passage of the CARES Act, which provides up to $50 billion of much needed liquidity to U.S. airlines. This unprecedented assistance recognizes the value that commercial airlines provide to our country and is designed to keep our hard-working team members employed and ready to serve the flying public whenever we start moving again. I want to again thank the administration and Congress for their exceptional support of airlines and our employees. I think it\u2019s important to note that this would not have been possible without a tremendous amount of work and advocacy on behalf of airlines and our team members, so I\u2019d also like to thank Nick Calio and his team at A4A as well as my A4A CEOs - Ed Bastian, Robin Hayes, Peter Ingram, Gary Kelly, Oscar Munoz, and Brad Tillman. We work in an intensely competitive business and in response to this crisis, we pulled together to save our industry and save jobs, and I\u2019m proud to have been a part of it.  We also had great support from our team members and the unions they represent. I\u2019d like to also publicly thank all of our American Airlines union leaders as well as those who represent other airline employees. We absolutely could not have gotten this done without their leadership and a joint desire from all of us to fight for our team.  As important as the CARES Act is, it certainly doesn\u2019t solve everything. CARES provides the industry the breathing room we need to manage through the worst parts of the crisis and to pay our team members that we otherwise would have needed to furlough. But it does not fix the core problem that all of us have, which is revenue generation. Industry revenues have fallen an estimated 95% year-over-year in April, and while no one has a perfect crystal ball, I think we\u2019d all expect the recovery will be slow and demand for air travel will be suppressed for quite some time.  In this environment, there are three critical issues that any airlines must face: first, ensuring the safety and comfort of team members and customers; second, maintaining ample liquidity to ride through a sustained crisis; and third, planning for an uncertain future. We at American are taking aggressive steps in each regard. I\u2019ll provide a quick overview, and then Robert and Derek will provide more detail on each.  First as it relates to safety, we dramatically increased the frequency and intensity of our aircraft cleaning. We\u2019re limiting seat sales on every flight, including not allowing half of the main cabin middle seats to be assigned. We\u2019ve reduced food and beverage service on flights to limit contact with others, and as of May 1, we will begin the gradual ramp-up of providing customers with PPE kits, which include masks and sanitizing wipes as well as requiring our flight attendants to wear masks in flight. Turning to liquidity, these efforts for all airlines come in sets of initiatives, raising cash and conserving cash. On the first, American\u2019s absolute liquidity position is very strong. We ended the first quarter with $6.8billion in liquidity and American\u2019s share of the CARES Act proceeds is $10.6 billion, which results in $17.4 billion when you combine our quarter end liquidity and CARES Act access.  Importantly, outside of our recently arranged $1 billion 364-day delayed draw term loan, we do not have any meaningful non-aircraft debt amortization payments for more than two years. We feel confident with that level of liquidity, but in this uncertain environment we\u2019ll continue looking for additional sources. We have more than $10 billion of unencumbered assets at our disposal and that excludes the value of our Advantage program. Our plan is to first work with the Treasury Department to secure our CARES Act loan of $4.75 billion at attractive rates and then explore other initiatives as needed from there.  As to conserving cash, Derek will describe our initiatives in more detail, but we\u2019ve enacted comprehensive cash conservation plan to eliminate all unnecessary operating and capital expenditures. We expect this will reduce our daily cash burn rate from an expected average of $70 million per day in the second quarter to approximately $50 million a day for month of June. As a result of all that, we expect to end this quarter with approximately $11 billion of liquidity and a significant amount of unencumbered assets still in place. That forecast assumes little to no increase in demand for air travel throughout the quarter. Third and perhaps the most difficult thing for airlines to do at this time is to properly plan for the future. We\u2019re using this opportunity to make our airlines stronger in a number of ways, and we expect to emerge a more efficient and more streamlined airline. To do that most efficiently, we need to begin making decisions soon about how large an airline we want to run in the summer of 2021 and beyond. As you all know, things like aircraft availability, pilot training, and maintenance programs do not have short planning horizons. That\u2019s always been an issue in our business, but today those capacity plans are severely complicated by the extreme uncertainty regarding the anticipated level of demand for air travel, not just for the next few months but for the next few years, so we at American decided to err on the side of being smaller than we might like rather than larger.  As Derek will describe and as our first quarter financials indicate, we made the decision to retire our entire 757, 767, A330-300 and Embraer 190 fleets, as well as certain regional aircraft. These decisions alone will reduce our 2021 fleet count by approximately 100 aircraft versus our prior plans, and we will continue to assess further reductions as we move forward. In conclusion from me, these are unprecedented times for our world, our country and our industry. The uncertainty about the future weighs on everyone, and for good reason. There is no way to overstate the gravity of the situation for the airline industry and difficult decisions lie ahead for all of us. But in the end, the leadership that got us through the CARES Act process will be the leadership that gets us through the coming months and years, leaders who understand the importance and the nobility of what our people do and therefore work selflessly in support of them and side by side with them. I\u2019m confident our industry will fight through this successfully, and I\u2019m particularly confident that American Airlines will be among those leading the way. I am humbled and honored to be a part of the American Airlines team and I\u2019m incredibly proud to stand alongside them today and into the future.  With that, I will turn it over to Robert. \nRobert Isom: Thanks Doug, and good morning everyone. As Doug said, the downturn in demand for air travel has been dramatic and unlike anything we\u2019ve ever experienced. Across the industry, cancellations have rapidly outpaced new bookings. While we have faced dire circumstances in the past, the American team has always persevered and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll do so again.  The safety of our team members and customers is paramount. We are taking a proactive approach to ensure that our team is safe by reducing contact points, providing personal protective equipment like face masks and gloves, and provisioning sanitizer and wipes. These steps are critical to ensure our team feels safe and can instill that confidence in our customers as well. Like Doug, I\u2019m humbled by our team\u2019s spirit and proud to stand by them in these challenging times.  American continues to provide critical air service to those who need to travel during the pandemic. From the outset, we have met or exceeded CDC guidelines and will continue to coordinate with public health officials on all health and safety requirements. To enhance our already thorough cleaning process, we have implemented additional safety measures to ensure aircraft cleanliness and to accommodate social distancing. Specifically, we are enhancing our cleaning procedures through expanded fogging on board and the use of EPA-approved disinfectant in high touch areas. On board, this includes everything from bins and galleys to tray tables, on racks, and seat belt buckles. In airports, it includes the gate areas, ticket counters, as well as other areas frequented by our customers and team members.  We\u2019ve also purchased face masks for frontline team members and made them required for flight attendants starting May 1. We have started distributing sanitizing wipes or gels and face masks to customers. This will expand on all flights as supplies and operational conditions allow. To that end, American Airlines strongly encourages customers to wear face masks when they travel. Additionally, we have temporarily relaxed our seating policies and adjusted our airport procedures. Through May 31, American will limit the number of passengers on each aircraft. We will not assign 50% of the main cabin middle seats on every flight and will use those seats only when necessary. Our team will also reassign seats to create more space between customers or to accommodate families who need to be seated together.  We are also using stanchions to encourage social distancing at gates and ticket counters, and we have reduced onboard food and beverage service to limit contact. To give customers as much peace of mind as possible when it comes to planning travel, we\u2019ve extended waivers to anyone who has travel current through the end of the September, allowing them to change plans and travel through December 21 without incurring any change fees. Additionally, we have waived change fees for customers who purchased new tickets by May 31, 2020 for future travel. For our corporate customers, we have introduced more flexible travel waivers and free name changes. We recognize the interruption of travel for most people, so we\u2019re making it easier for our customers to earn Advantage Elite status this year, and we\u2019ve extended 2020 Advantage status into early 2022 for all members. Additionally, we have extended all paid Admiral\u2019s Club memberships by six months. We remain committed to making sure that our customers are able to fly when they want to fly, and that they feel safe and comfortable even in these extraordinary times.  We have adjusted our network to meet drastically lower levels of demand, taking swift action to right-size our schedule with system-wide capacity cuts and flight consolidations across our network. We\u2019ve also delayed entering several new markets planned for launch later this year. New service between Austin and DFW, Christchurch and Los Angeles, Bangalore and Seattle will all be pushed into 2021. In addition, we have delayed the start of other new routes, including London-Heathrow to Boston, Tel Aviv to Dallas-Fort Worth, Casablanca to Philadelphia, and Krakow to Chicago.  While we have reduced our schedule dramatically, we started operating cargo-only flights in March to transport critical goods between the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America. These are the first cargo-only flights American has operated since at least 1984. We are currently able to transport more than 6.5 million pounds of critical goods weekly on our cargo-only flights and will look for further opportunities to expand the service and bring medical supplies and protective gear to the areas that are most in need.  While we continue to provide essential air service to those who need it most right now, our team has also extended their service outside of the operations. Team members have donated more than 100 tons of food in several of our hub cities, distributed thousands of supply kits to patients and healthcare workers, and sent care packages to U.S. military members in quarantine. In addition, through our partnership with the American Red Cross, our team and customers have helped raise nearly $3 million to support our frontline healthcare workers fighting COVID-19. In closing, we\u2019re squarely focused on getting through this period of uncertainty and we\u2019re closely managing our capacity and costs while taking care of our team members and customers. We\u2019ll have a lot more to share in the coming months as we ramp up our operations post COVID-19. With that, I\u2019ll pass it on to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks Robert, and good morning everyone. I too would like to thank our entire team for doing an amazing job during these uncertain times. Their dedication and determination to get through this crisis is inspiring for all of us. As you saw in our press release and Form 10-Q this morning, we reported a GAAP net loss of $2.2 billion or $5.26 per share. Excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $1.1 billion or $2.65 per share. We began the quarter on track to exceed our guidance; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented drop in demand during March radically changed our outlook. Given the unpredictable nature of this event, we suspended our guidance for all of 2020. In light of the current environment, our sole focus is to ensure we have sufficient liquidity. To withstand this crisis, we have driven efficiencies in our operations by accelerating our fleet simplification plan and aligning our cost structure to our significantly lower capacity levels. We will continue to match capacity with demand and optimize our costs to our level of flying and identify additional ways to improve our cash burn rate moving forward. As Doug mentioned, the significant fall-off in demand has given us an opportunity to accelerate our long-term fleet strategy. We have officially retired the Embraer 190 and Boeing 767 fleets, which were originally scheduled to exit by the end of 2020. We have also accelerated the retirement of our Boeing 757s and Airbus A330-300s. Both fleets were expected to retire over the next few years. In addition, we have removed a number of smaller regional aircraft from our fleet. By removing these fleet types, we avoid significant future maintenance expense, remove complexity from our operations, and bring forward the efficiencies associated with operating fewer aircraft types. These savings include reduced aircraft sparing, reduced parts inventories, and crew scheduling efficiencies, all of which will have a significant effect on our cost structure going forward. Even with these changes, we retain the flexibility to pursue efficient growth through increased utilization or further reduce our fleet to match demand across our system and hubs. We have reduced our estimated 2020 operating and capital expenditures by more than $12 billion. In addition to lower fuel, these savings have been achieved through a wide range of initiatives, including reductions in flying and heavy maintenance expenses. Beyond just volume related reductions, we have taken a hard line on discretionary expenditures. Specifically, we have deferred marketing [indiscernible] event and training expenses, consolidated our footprint at airport facilities, and reduced the use of contractors. We have also suspended all non-essential hiring, paused non-contract pay increases, reduced execution and board compensation, and implemented voluntary leave and early retirement programs to lower our near term and long term labor costs. While we have done a lot to address our near term costs, we will continue to take the necessary steps to right-size our cost structure for the lower levels of capacity we expect in the near future. Finally on liquidity, we\u2019ve moved quickly to reserve and bolster our cash position. We ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in liquidity. During the first quarter, we raised $2 billion through the issuance of $500 million of unsecured notes, a $1 billion 364-day delayed draw term loan facility, and approximately $477 million in aircraft financings. We were also able to reduce the pricing of our $1.2 billion term loan and extend it out until 2027. During the quarter, we also finalized the initial terms of the financial assistance we will receive as part of the CARES Act. This will come in two forms: direct financial assistance of $4.1 billion and a low interest rate loan of $1.7 billion. Separately, we have applied for a loan from the Treasury Department of approximately $4.75 billion. These funds as well as relief on various taxes, including fuel tax savings, payroll tax deferment, and ticket-related taxes will provide much needed support for us to navigate this extraordinary environment. As Doug referenced, we ended the quarter at $6.8 billion in liquidity and American shares of the CARES Act proceeds is $10.6 billion, which results in $17.4 billion when you combine our quarterly ending liquidity and CARES Act access. Importantly, outside of our recently arranged $1 billion 364-day delayed draw term loan, we do not have any large non-aircraft debt maturities for more than 24 months.  We also have additional sources of liquidity. We recently engaged third party appraisers to evaluate some of the company\u2019s unencumbered assets. Based on these appraisals, we believe the value of our unencumbered assets is in excess of $10 billion, excluding the loyalty program, and we expect to pledge a portion of our assets for the secured loan we have applied for under the CARES Act. With respect to capital expenditures, we currently have committed financing for nearly all of our 2020 deliveries. Beyond this, we have removed $500 million from our projected non-aircraft capital spend plan in 2020 and another $200 million in 2021. We\u2019ll continue to aggressively pursue other opportunities to conserve cash and working capital.  As for cash burn, our average estimated second quarter burn rate is expected to be approximately $70 million per day; however, as our cost initiatives gain traction, our daily cash burn is expected to decline over time. We expect that burn rate to improve to approximately $50 million per day for the month of June. Based on our current forecast, we expect to have approximately $11 billion of liquidity at the end of the second quarter, which assumes no incremental financing beyond the government loan and little to no increase in demand for air travel. In accordance with the CARES Act, we have suspended our capital return program, including share repurchases and the payment of future dividends.  In summary, we are facing a challenge that is unlike anything we have ever seen. In a short period of time, our team did a phenomenal job taking cost out of the business and increasing liquidity. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what they have all accomplished, but we are by no means done and we are prepared for a long road to recovery. While the situation remains fluid, we will do everything possible to protect our business and ensure American emerges from this crisis more efficient and competitive than before. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator.\nDan Cravens: Thanks Derek. Operator, we are ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein. Go ahead, Mr. Vernon.\nDavid Vernon : Sorry about that, guys - work from home fun. Derek, just to clarify, the $11 billion of liquidity at the end of the second quarter, that assumes the inflow from both portions of the CARES Act, the grant and the loan. Is that right?\nDerek Kerr: Correct. There is a portion of--there\u2019s 10% of the grant that does come in the second quarter, so there\u2019s about $600 million of the grant that shows up in July. But for the most part, yes, it includes about $10 billion of the government grant and loan, and then $600 million of it comes in July.\nDavid Vernon: Okay, and then as we think about the moving parts to get down to that $50 million burn rate, how much of the actions that would get you to 50 would be either temporary through voluntary time off arrangements? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for how much of an additional cut to the cash burn rate you guys are going to need to make in that September time frame as the CARES loans come off, because $50 million a day, $10 billion left, it gets you to the first part of next year, but it seems like there\u2019s still some work to be done on the cost side there. Can you give us a sense for how much more you can get out of that $50 million a day?\nDerek Kerr: Yes, I\u2019ll tell you how we get there. The difference between where we are now and where we get to is there\u2019s been a significant amount of refunds, so that has caused the number to be higher now than it has. As disbursements take hold, those take a little bit of time, so those are now starting to take hold and will stay in place as we go forward. The voluntary leaves and early outs, the early outs will be there forever, the voluntary leaves we have some three months, some six months, some nine months, and we believe if we need to do that in the future, we can do that again. The capex reductions are permanent and those are out throughout the whole time, and some of this is reductions in departures. The $50 billion assumes really very minimal receipts, so the difference, I think from a cost structure perspective, all of this is in place and can stay in place. The difference of that burn rate, as Doug talked about earlier, the issue with the industry right now is revenues, and to get that burn rate from a cost perspective, we have some more levers to go to bring it down, but the major difference in the burn rate is going to be receipts coming back and having some revenue coming in the door, versus refunds outpacing revenue and having no receipts come in the door.\nDoug Parker: And David, I would just add to what Derek said in his comments to your question, which is that $11 billion at quarter end does assume the government loan but it also assumes we\u2019ve done other financing, so we expect to end the quarter still with a significant amount of unencumbered assets still in place. There would be more to do beyond that if we need to.\nDavid Vernon: All right, thanks guys.\nDoug Parker: Thanks David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. \nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning everyone. Just a couple questions here. When I look at your capex, I guess it was $3.3 billion coming in, and Derek, I think you indicated that $500 million of non-aircraft would be taken out, so I think it was 1.6, we\u2019re looking at about $1.1 billion of non-aircraft capex, if you could just talk about what that $1.1 billion is. And then the $1.7 billion of aircraft capex you indicated that you\u2019ve already--it\u2019s already funded, presumably those aircraft deliveries are actually cash accretive. Can you talk about maybe how that\u2019s structured? Thanks.\nDerek Kerr: Yes, I\u2019ll take the second one first. The answer is yes, they are cash accretive. They are 100% financed, if not more, so all of those--we do plan on taking all of those deliveries, and they are positive to the 2020 forecast. Most of the deliveries are in the back half because they\u2019re Maxes that had been pushed out, but those are all cash accretive as we go forward. As far as the capex, we\u2019re down to about 1.1. We\u2019ve cut out everything that we can. The biggest project that\u2019s in capex is our consolidating the fleets and making sure that the configuration on both of the fleets is the same. That project is going to continue and we are going to--you know, with the aircraft on the ground, we\u2019ll have the ability to speed that up a little bit, so. We don\u2019t plan on pulling back on that project because I think it\u2019s very important for our operation, it\u2019s very important for the team to get that one done, and that takes up at least 40% of that capex.  The rest of it is just mandatory stuff we have to do with parts. There are some other IT projects that we\u2019d still like to move forward with, and those are involved in that, but that\u2019s kind of the gist of where we\u2019re at. Anything that doesn\u2019t have to be done, any type of facility things that don\u2019t have to be done have all been taken out of the capital plan for the next two years.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. My second question, just on the fleet, your 950 airplanes main line, I think you identified close to 100. That said, you have a relatively new fleet, so when we look at the next 850, fleet reductions become a bit more difficult since you have a lot of new airplanes. I\u2019m curious, what would you target next, and just sort of a nuance there, the A330s, you\u2019re pulling out the 300s but you have 15 200s, are those planes next or is it more about just the way that they\u2019re financed and the lease agreements? Thanks for taking my questions.\nDerek Kerr: No, I think there is two fleet types that we\u2019ve looked at that, that it\u2019s just a question of the timing of the return and do they come back, depending on where we are, so the flexibility--as you talked about, the 332s, there\u2019s 15 of those, we have 737s, there\u2019s 42 older aircraft that we\u2019ve looked at, so those are a couple of the areas that we would go. We have lease expirations of 26 in 2021 and 21 in 2022, so those are out there, and we do have some older A320s that you could look at. But I think there is the levers to go down farther. The 332 is more fleet simplification for sure, if you went down that path, but as you said, they\u2019re financed out a ways. But we\u2019re looking at those are the fleet types that we\u2019re looking at as we go forward and then maybe you have some lease expirations that you let go next year.\nRobert Isom: And Derek, 50 seizures, corresponding about 50 seizures as well.\nMike Linenberg: Yes, okay. Good point. All right, thanks everyone.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody. [Indiscernible] negotiations are going well or you wouldn\u2019t have put the government loan in your liquidity build, but is there a Plan B in case the Treasury turns you down? As a follow-up, have we also confirmed with Treasury, and I may have just overlooked this, that 100% of the proceeds could be drawn all at once?\nDerek Kerr: We\u2019re having a--we\u2019ve been working with Treasury. The government grant process went really well. We really appreciate everything they\u2019ve done for this program. You know we\u2019ve put in for the loans a week ago, a week and a half ago, so we\u2019ve started to have some conversations, but our working with the Treasury team and the PJT team has been great. We\u2019ve had constructive conversations as we move forward, and with the collateral we have, we believe that there is--we can get a deal done and that everything--that they\u2019re going to be reasonable about it.  So we\u2019re moving down that path, we believe we\u2019re going to get it done, and so that\u2019s our number one goal as we move forward, to get that complete first. Then with the extra collateral we will have left in the end is to go down and look at other opportunities as we move forward, but I\u2019m confident that working with the Treasury Department and the team that we can get the government loan put in place.\nDoug Parker: Jamie, it\u2019s Doug, if you don\u2019t mind. Just to--that gives me a nice opportunity to thank some people at Treasury as well. Look, you and I were amongst those that were around in 2001, and I was running an airline that needed help to get through that from the Treasury Department, and it was extraordinarily difficult. This feels dramatically different than that time. This Treasury Department is working night and day to do everything they can to get much needed liquidity into the U.S. economy, to make sure that the economy is able to get running again, so that includes how they are treating this airline support. It was clear with the payroll support program, I think how they handled that. They are doing what they have to do, of course, which is make sure that the U.S. taxpayer is paid back, so when it came to the payroll support program, that they could absolutely guarantee we\u2019re getting paid back through things like unemployment savings and higher income taxes. Seventy percent of the grant was indeed a grant. That that wasn\u2019t went into a loan, but a very low interest loan over 10 years. As it relates to the loan program itself, they have--at the time we talked about the payroll support plan, they were good enough to talk to all of us about the loan program itself and recognized again that they want to be sure that the taxpayers are repaid, but I think they know the best way to do that is ensure that airlines have liquidity to get through a liquidity crisis.  Again, we still have to get through the work here in the next few weeks, but you\u2019re right, we wouldn\u2019t have talked about how we\u2019re looking to that as our next source of most efficient capital if we didn\u2019t feel confident that it would be the next source of efficient capital. But their view is five year loans, different rates for carriers based upon credit rating, as we were told. For us, it\u2019s LIBOR plus 3.50. At today\u2019s LIBOR, that\u2019s a little over 4% on five-year money. That is the most efficient financing out there for American Airlines, and they\u2019re looking for--it needs to be secured, but I think they\u2019re willing to be more than reasonable about collateral, and also looking for appraisals that we have, that we feel very confident that we will be able to arrange that loan and still have significant unencumbered collateral after.\nJamie Baker: Got it. Doug, that perspective is actually really, really valuable, because you\u2019re right - the United precedent with the ATSB was clearly on my mind, so I appreciate all of that commentary.  A quick follow-up to your earlier comment, Doug, about resizing the franchise. It might have been sort of where Mike was going as well - my phone was cutting in and out. Not looking for a 2021 capacity guide, unless you want to give us one, but my question is how much could you shrink relative to the 2019 baseline if you only put down owned aircraft and allow leases to expire? I guess put differently, how much could you shrink before there begins to be a cost in terms of parking aircraft? Not thinking about facilities, not thinking about the toll on labor, just a specific aircraft question.\nDoug Parker: Additional airplanes above the 100 that we\u2019ve already announced?\nJamie Baker: Well, you still have owned and fully depreciated aircraft, you have lease expirations coming up that I don\u2019t have particularly good clarity, and if you allow those to expire and put down owned aircraft, there\u2019s no real expense to that. My question is how much on a percentage basis could you shrink ASMs before contemplating putting down an airplane for which there is still an ownership cost or a lease expense? Is that 10% relative to 2019, is it 20%? And if you don\u2019t have the figures, that\u2019s fine - we\u2019ve done some back of the envelope, I was just curious to hear your take.\nVasu Raja: Hey Jamie, this is Vasu. The figure\u2019s a little bit different on an airplane basis versus an ASM basis, because our gauge will change, so on an ASM basis we estimate that number between 15% to 20%, depending on how you draw that time period. My number includes all jets - regionals, narrow bodies, wide bodies, so on an ASM basis, that number is probably more in the 10% to 15% because of course the things we would look to do are take out smaller jets like 50-seaters and keep more economical things like bigger 737s, 321s, things like that.\nJamie Baker: Perfect. That\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. I\u2019ll pass the mic to the next analyst. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Good luck.\nDoug Parker: Thank you Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Derek, can you just talk about the nature of the unencumbered assets that you have, realistically what sort of capital you could raise against that? Then what is the value of the loyalty program, since that\u2019s kind of a pretty big note between--you know, that\u2019s still out there for you? Thank you.\nDerek Kerr: Yes, I think--you know, going to number two, you\u2019re the one that has done the best work on the loyalty program by far, and your number is pretty good from where we have an appraisal of the program. I think the value of that program is high, and I think you have pointed that out, rightly so, and you are in the range of appraisals that we\u2019ve gotten back for that. That has a very high value to us. Of the $10 billion, about $2 billion is aircraft spare parts, engines, those kinds of things. About $5 billion is slots, so that gets us to seven. We\u2019ve got A/R about $1.8 billion and real estate about $1.2 billion, so there are different things we can do with different products. Of that $10 billion, 40% maybe loan to value on certain things, 40% to 50%, just in the fact that I think some can do more than others and gain more cash from an LTV basis than other collateral. But maybe I\u2019d say 4 to 5. We also have in our slots, gates and routes the 364 deal that we have to refinance at some point in time. There is $4.4 billion of collateral in there which will be used at some point in time to refinance and probably do a bigger transaction as you combine that with other collateral that we have.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then maybe for Vasu, what is getting as much smaller as you think you might on the other side of this mean for the hub structure of the network? Thank you.\nVasu Raja: Yes, thanks for the question, which I\u2019m going to interpret to mean, does this mean that we shrink hubs or eliminate ones, so let me be very direct about this. We have no plans to close any hubs, in fact far from it. As we see this--look, the core of our customer proposition is providing connectivity, and indeed that is something that we do not just versus all other airlines, but even all other network airlines. We are uniquely good at providing connections from customers in small cities across the Americas, North and South America, that connect them to the global marketplace.  As dark and daunting as this crisis is, this is the moment for real clarity, and so this is not about dismantling our customer proposition but sharpening it and refocusing it. With that in mind, the way we are thinking about trying to get a lot of the same value that historically people tried to rein through hub closure, it\u2019s first and foremost, as Derek and Doug mentioned, through fleet simplification, which is big. If we just take out fleet, of course you take our direct expense, so when we simplify away fleets, then you take out more intractable expenses like indirect costs of parts and tooling, fixed overhead, things like that. But importantly, that makes the airline a lot more lean and a lot more nimble, a lot more capable of being able to move fleets around markets, respond to a recovery when and if it comes, many of the things that have been difficult for us to do, frankly, over the last four or five years.  Then two, the other thing that we look to do with that kind of agility is really put the capacity even more aggressively to where the demand is, and without going too far into it, I think I can very confidently say you won\u2019t see us de-peaking DFW through this whole process - in fact, far from it. Then the third thing, which is really different from past crises for us, is really the power of our partnerships here, because now we have things such as our growing partnership with Alaska on the west coast, that in a lot of markets that are challenged, that growth is inhibited because of constraints on slots or dates or routes. What we\u2019re now able to do is offer the customer a much larger network that can compete with bigger rivals in oftentimes unwinnable markets, so that means that we should be able to see that in higher quality revenues for American Airlines at a lower amount of investment. So we do not plan for mass scale hub closures; in fact, our hubs are a massive asset to us as we think about a really very focused customer proposition coming out of this.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigworth from Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigworth: Hey, thanks. Doug, good morning. Regarding your commentary about a multi-year recovery and what this looks like in the long term, just curious if you could share what the financial targets are that will shape your plans. As we think about the crisis here and now, burning over $6 billion in cash just this quarter, your exit rate implies about a $4.5 billion burn rate into 3Q, net debt on its way to perhaps $40 billion this year. What are the financial targets that will shape your 2021 plans - burn less cash?\nDoug Parker: Thanks Duane. At this point, we\u2019re working, again as I think all of us are, at getting through the current liquidity crisis rather than building 2021 plans. But for certain as we come out of this--you know, prior to this, American had gotten to the point where we were happily through a large capex program and were moving aggressively toward using our free cash flow to de-lever the balance sheet. That will certainly be the case as we come out of this now as we do move to generating free cash flow in the future. The proceeds of that free cash flow will be going to pay down debt and to pay it down as aggressively as we can.  That\u2019s what you can expect to see when we get to that point, but nothing more concrete than that in terms of estimates or metrics for 2021 at this point.\nDuane Pfennigworth: Then just on the $11 billion liquidity target, what are you assuming for the working capital headwind related to the air traffic liability? We had a lot of questions around this for a number of airlines, not just American, but can you walk us through the mechanics of why the ATL did not decline in the March quarter and the outlook for that into the June quarter, considering things like cancellations, etc.? Thanks for taking the questions.\nDerek Kerr: Yes, I think the ATL didn\u2019t decline in the quarter because it was positive by about--our ATL for the quarter was positive 665. We had positive 785 in January, positive 487 in February, and negative 618 in March. That is the time when ATL does build for us, and if you--you know, this didn\u2019t even really hit until middle of March, so those two happened. We did have refunds during the quarter of about $900 million, so we did have ATL grow, we had refunds of $900 million really driven by sales in the first two months of the time period. We do believe that ATL will decline in the second quarter. Our projections, I think April we had refunds--we haven\u2019t finalized it yet, but we think it\u2019s in the $600 million range, if not more, and we do project about $400 million in May and about $200 million more in June, so the quarter is going to be hit by some $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion worth of refunds, and that is built into the daily cash burn numbers that we gave you. That\u2019s why we talked about receipts being really low in the $70 billion a day daily burn, so that is built in. We do have an ATL that we think is going to be negative, but in the first quarter it was positive really because as we entered March, things looked really good from where we were, and I think for all people that was pretty much the same picture. We just had the burn coming in, in March.\nDuane Pfennigworth: Very clear, thanks Derek.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Hunter Kay from Wolfe Research.\nHunter Kay: Good morning. Thanks for getting me on. This is kind of a follow-on to the question. I know you don\u2019t want to talk about \u201921, but how do you plan on digging out of this debt pile here, Doug? Based on what Vasu said, it doesn\u2019t seem like you guys are going to be really gutting costs, so pragmatically speaking, how do you dig out of this debt pile? How do you generate that free cash flow once you get through this crisis?\nDoug Parker: Through earnings. Again, we were nicely forecasting positive free cash flow prior to this. We need to get back to a point where we\u2019re generating free cash flow in the future, and as we do that, like I say, we\u2019ll be using that to pay down the debt over time. As Derek noted, while we do indeed come out of this with more debt than we would have liked, as it relates to the actual cash flow situation regarding the debt, we don\u2019t have any major amortizations for the next couple years, and like I say, as we come out of this, like all carriers, and get to a point--we need to get to a point again where we\u2019re generating positive cash flow, which we certainly will at some point, and when we do that, we\u2019ll use that to pay down the debt as we go forward.\nDerek Kerr: And Hunter, we are really good at--I mean, the work that\u2019s been done to get the cost structure where it is right now is only beginning, so Vasu and his team are working through what the schedule is going to look like in 2021. The whole purpose of retiring fleets was to simplify things and to drive the cost structure to where it needs to be, and we\u2019re still looking at other opportunities to do that. We will go through a comprehensive look at the expenses of the airline over the next few months here to right-size the expenses to where Vasu\u2019s going from a network perspective. \nHunter Kay: Okay. Then of the 39,000 volunteers for early retirement and the like, how many of those 39,000 are permanently retired?\nDerek Kerr: There\u2019s 4,500 early outs.\nHunter Kay: Thank you Derek.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Miles Walton from UBS.\nMiles Walton: Thanks, good morning. Doug, I just had a question for you on customer behavior, specifically as you alter some of the procedures for safety on board the plane. Something like blocking the middle seat, how long do you think something like that lasts if customers get used to it? Is it potentially that you\u2019re putting it in there and it has to stay through vaccine development next year? How is that going to feed into your building of 4Q type of projections and scheduling?\nDoug Parker: A really good question. All of this is rapidly evolving, and today it\u2019s not much of an issue, obviously. Over 80% of our flights I think are going out with lower than 25% load factor, so that constraint comes into play on a very, very rare basis. We think it\u2019s the right thing at this point in time. Again, I can\u2019t really answer your question other than to say it will continue to evolve over time. Today what we\u2019re seeing is much more of a push toward facial coverings to give customers a level of comfort. We certainly are strongly encouraging that, and indeed as we said, we\u2019ll soon - tomorrow - begin providing customers with masks to strongly encourage them to use them.  Look, right now we think that\u2019s an important part of the message to our customers, to know that we\u2019re not going to have every seat on the airplane filled. There will be some seats available for those that require it, and we, as other airlines, right now think that\u2019s an important part of the messaging. But again, we\u2019ll see where that evolves over time. I don\u2019t know that I can answer you any better than that.\nMiles Walton: No, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just a slippery slope when you start to put something in place and you don\u2019t know exactly when to peel it back. Just wondering how you were thinking about it. Then maybe just a clarification on the CARES loan. How much of the unencumbered assets are you proposing to pledge against that, so we can know quarter end what your unencumbered assets are? Thanks. \nDerek Kerr: We don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019re still working with the Treasury to finalize that. It hasn\u2019t been determined and we\u2019ll just continue to work with them on what the right collateral value is for the $4.75 billion loan.\nDoug Parker: Maybe I\u2019ll just reiterate what we said - of the $10 billion plus the Advantage program that we have available today, we certainly expect that we will have ample collateral available for the Treasury Department to feel good about their $4.75 billion loan being secured, and still have significant unencumbered assets after that process.\nMiles Walton: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Didora from Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for getting me in here at the end. Just wanted to go back to the CARES Act. I guess my understanding of the government loan program is that government appears to be a lender of last resort and you need to exhaust a lot of your other avenues of financing before accessing the program. Based on your explanation, I think it\u2019s fair to assume--you know, would you agree that I\u2019m maybe off on this interpretation?  Then as a follow-up to Miles\u2019 question, in your discussions with the Treasury, have they indicated the type of collateral that they would be willing to take? Just trying to get a sense of what you could have left if you need to go to the public markets. Thanks. \nDoug Parker: Sure Andrew. Let me start and then Derek can fill in with details. As to the lender of last resort point, I don\u2019t have the legislation in front of me but it says something to the effect of [indiscernible] has to show they don\u2019t have reasonable access to public markets, or something like that. Again, in discussions with them, and I can\u2019t stress enough again how exceptionally reasonable and helpful they\u2019re being to all of us, we proposed things, we mentioned things such as--you know, for example in February or sometime earlier this year, we were able to do a C-tranche on a EETC at--\nDerek Kerr: We did it unsecured at 3.7.\nDoug Parker: We did an unsecured deal at 3.7, so we could do a C-tranche on an EETC at something lower than that. Today if we tried to do a C-tranche on an EETC, it\u2019s some double digit number. They\u2019re certainly not saying go do that. They view that as reasonable financing not being available at reasonable terms, so that\u2019s--again, that\u2019s for them to ascertain, but certainly their views seem to be not that you need to go raise--use all the collateral you have and turn to them only when there\u2019s nothing else you can do, irrespective of the cost.  So again, I think it is, one, the right thing to do for what they\u2019re trying to accomplish, which is ensure the industry has liquidity it needs at reasonable rate, and what we\u2019ve been told they\u2019re going to do, so again I\u2019d use this opportunity to thank them, not just Secretary Mnuchin, who we thank a lot, but Undersecretary Brent McIntosh, Deputy Secretary Justin Muzinich. The entire team has just been really very helpful about this. Then as to the collateral, again all I can say is that\u2019s what we need to work though, and we have $10 million of unencumbered plus the Advantage program, which has appraised values that are, as Derek indicated, awfully high. Given all that, we feel good about what we have said, which is we will go raise the government loan and still have significant unencumbered assets outstanding.  Let me use this opportunity for one more--to give credit where credit is due to Derek and the treasury team. These numbers we\u2019re giving, $11 billion at year end--sorry, at quarter end, with the government loan has thus far the most expensive debt we will have raised, and in that analysis is this government loan, so not saying that we won\u2019t need to do other things in the future, but we\u2019ve been going about this, going to go to the most efficient source of financing throughout, and I think we\u2019ve done really well. I feel good about that and we\u2019ll continue to do that, and right now that\u2019s the next most efficient tranche to go after, so that\u2019s where we expect to go. To the extent beyond that we need to do other things, we obviously will do so. I think Gary Kelly on the Southwest call said this as well - there is asymmetrical risk right now for cash. Not having enough is really expensive; having too much may be somewhat expensive, but you\u2019ll just use that to pay down the debt sooner. That\u2019s certainly the way we view it, and we\u2019re going about it in a way of raising that which is most efficient first and getting to those that are less efficient later.\nAndrew Didora: Great, thank you for that, Doug. Lastly Derek, just a quick modeling question here. In the $50 million daily cash burn rate in June and beyond, what are you assuming--what is the EETC amortization assumptions in that number? Thanks.\nDerek Kerr: The EETC amortization for 2020 is about $2.2 billion for the full year. \nAndrew Didora: Great, thank you.\nOperator: At this time, we will take questions from the media. If members of the media would like to ask a question, please press star, one.  Your first question comes from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. \nAlison Sider: Hi, thanks so much. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about any supply chain issues you\u2019re seeing for masks. Where are you getting all these masks for crew and for passengers, and is it getting easier to find them?\nRobert Isom: Ali, it\u2019s Robert. I\u2019ll give you what we know. Look - there\u2019s a lot of planning that goes into provisioning masks and sanitizers, and when we contemplated making changes to our cleaning programs and also any type of amenities for our customers, things have changed rapidly in just two or three weeks.  As we take a look forward, with sanitizer we see ample supplies. With masks, it is a logistical issue of getting inventories to the right place, but we have sufficient quantities for our team, and as our commitment to offer masks and sanitizer to customers in flight, you\u2019ll see us rolling that out. Our supply chain, it will take a number of weeks, but it\u2019s not an issue of months at this point. I can\u2019t point you to the exact sources of supply, but I will say that things have certainly eased--constraints have certainly eased over the last few weeks, to the point that we are able to make commitments like we have to both our tam and our customers. \nAlison Sider: Got it, thanks. I know you can\u2019t say exactly where, but we\u2019ve heard of other airlines having to go to Asia, or to China in particular to get masks. Is that where some of the sourcing is?\nRobert Isom: We\u2019re sourcing wherever we can get the quality product that meets our needs throughout the country, but I don\u2019t have the specifics on what percentage comes from where.\nAlison Sider: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kyle Arnold from Dallas Morning News.\nKyle Arnold: Hey, thanks for taking my call. You mentioned the 39,000 employees that took the early out leave and reduced hours. Can you talk a little bit about what your permanent workforce situation might look like after that CARES Act restrictions [indiscernible] and how you\u2019re going to be looking at the needs and the size of the airline during the next few months?\nDoug Parker: Kyle, it\u2019s Doug. Obviously hard to tell given the uncertainty around demand where we will be and how fast the consumer returns and how much we want to fly. But certainly given what we announced today with the retirement of all these aircraft, we will emerge from this in the fall with a smaller airline than we had anticipated prior to the virus, of course, and going into 2021 as a smaller airline. We will most certainly, irrespective of where demand is, go into the fall with more team members than we have work for, which is a challenge for certain. We hope to get through that the same way we\u2019ve gotten to this point.  The fact that we had 40,000--39,000 of our team members volunteer for leaves and early retirement, I think is an indication that we hopefully can be able to manage through that without having to do furloughs at that time. That\u2019d certainly be our goal, to go through and make sure that we have the airline right-sized, properly sized, a good bit smaller than it is today, but do so in a way that takes care of our team, which has been front of mind through this entire process.  We\u2019ll look to do that, but those decisions are things we\u2019re going to have to make when we get to that point, and that\u2019s a goal at this point, one that I hope we can meet but not a certainty. Again, this is not unique to American. I think we\u2019re all working through this at this point. As for right now, we\u2019re working through the summer and through the terms and conditions on the CARES Act itself, and as we get into the fall, we\u2019ll have to work--we will certainly be working productivity with our team to make sure we\u2019re right-sized.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. \nMary Schlangenstein: Good morning. I wanted to ask, when you all have been mentioning the Advantage program as not being included in your unencumbered assets, can you talk about your willingness or your unwillingness to have to use that as collateral?\nDoug Parker: Derek, do you have an answer for Mary?\nDerek Kerr: No, I think there is willingness to use all of our collateral that is necessary for us to increase the liquidity to where we need it to be.\nDoug Parker: We wouldn\u2019t [indiscernible] the program, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. [Indiscernible] as an asset that we can use to raise much needed liquidity in this time, obviously we\u2019re absolutely willing to consider it.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay, and if I can also ask, on the worker leaves, do you have any information in terms of--you know, since there are 3-6-9s, what percentage of those folks would be coming back right around September 30, when the restrictions on CARES Act loans go away?\nDoug Parker: I don\u2019t know that we have that information, Mary. I don\u2019t think we have that.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay, just wondering if that\u2019s going to complicate your decisions going forward on whether you need to have furloughs or not, if you\u2019ve got a bunch of folks coming back off of leave at that time. If that becomes available and I could get that, I\u2019d appreciate it.\nDoug Parker: Yes, well anyway--Elise, do you want to answer that?\nElise Eberwein: Yes Mary, I can call you offline about that. I would tell you that some of these leaves, the 3-6-9 months, we\u2019ll be going back out and looking at extending those wherever we can if needed.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Leslie Josephs from CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the open labor agreements, how does coronavirus and this need to be a smaller airline affect those, and as you think about furloughs, how do any of the existing labor contracts affect those discussions? \nDoug Parker: The existing labor negotiations, flight attendants and pilots we\u2019re in negotiations with, those negotiations--obviously it has an impact on those as we all work on the pace of those negotiations, we\u2019ll still continue to talk and work through those to the extent we can. But right now, all of our team is working to take care of our team members through this issue, so certainly nothing to report about those moving forward beyond where they were at this point. Again as it relates to the labor contracts, as I said, our goal is to get through this without furloughs to our team. I\u2019m sure our unions would support that goal and we\u2019ll work together to figure out hopefully ways that we can do that, so that we have the workforce right-sized but have those that want to avail themselves of leaves or early outs doing so, and those that need to be working doing that as well. We\u2019ll work with them on that.  I would note again--yes, go ahead?\nLeslie Josephs: On the leaves, do you have any sense of why so many people are taking those leaves? Is it childcare? Can\u2019t go to another airline though, but--\nElise Eberwein: Yes Leslie, it\u2019s Elise. It\u2019s a combination of things, from childcare needs to wanting to take the summer away from flying, so it\u2019s a variety of needs. It all depends on the individual. \nLeslie Josephs: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Edward Russell, PPG.\nEdward Russell: Thanks for taking my question. Vasu, I was wondering if you could go a bit more into your statement on all the hubs coming back. Should we expect some hubs to come back faster or more robustly than others? I know you\u2019ve been talking in the last few years about Charlotte, Dallas and Washington being the strongest hubs.\nVasu Raja: Hey Ned, thanks for the question. It remains to be seen, quite frankly. As Derek mentioned, we are just now starting kind of a clean sheet exercise for what 2021 might look like, and so I couldn\u2019t tell you with a lot of clarity. But for right now as we look at our schedule, clearly we have our biggest connecting complexes that are out there, primarily so that we can serve the vast majority of communities under the CARES Act with a minimum of resource expenditure, so that\u2019s all you kind of see in our existing schedule today. Everything beyond it remains to be seen yet. \nEdward Russell: Great, thank you. Then one point of clarification - Robert, you mentioned some older 737s that could be retired. How many were they - were they 42? I missed that number. \nRobert Isom: Yes, 42.\nEdward Russell: Great, thank you.\nDerek Kerr: Operator, I think we\u2019re done taking questions.\nOperator: That is correct, sir. There are no further questions at this time.\nDoug Parker: Excellent. All right, well thanks everybody for your time and attention. I will close where I closed my comments, with obviously this is a difficult time for our industry and our country, but we couldn\u2019t be more proud of how our team and our industry is managing through this. We will get through this, I\u2019m certain of that. I know our industry will get through this. We\u2019ll fight through this successfully, and I\u2019m particularly confident that American Airlines will be among those leading the way. We\u2019ll keep you apprised as we move forward.  If you have any further questions, please either contact Investor Relations or Corporate Communications. Thanks a lot. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conduct at question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And now I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.\nDan Cravens: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to the American Airlines fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us in the room this morning is Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for our question-and-answer session are several of our senior execs, including Maya Leibman, who is our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications, Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management; and Vasu Raja our Senior VP of Network Planning and Alliance. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and other commercial initiatives. Derek will then walk us through the details of the fourth quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for 2020. And then after we hear from those comments, we will open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans, and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q from the third quarter September -- ending September 30, 2019. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on the website, the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us this morning. At this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thanks Dan. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today we reported our fourth quarter and full year results for 2019. Excluding net special items, our fourth quarter net earnings were $1.15 per diluted share that's up 19% year-over-year. And our full year net earnings were $4.90 per diluted share that's up 8% on a year-over-year basis. While it's a solid year-over-year improvement especially given the tough environment we experienced, we know we can perform better and we will. As we look to 2020, we remain focused on three key areas that will create real value for our shareholders; producing excellent operating results; growing efficiently and profitably; and generating significant free cash flow. The past few months prove that that work is already paying off. When we spoke in October, we noted two key challenges that affected our third quarter earnings. First, we were on the heels of subpar operating reliability results as we work through labor contract negotiations. And second, our 2019 earnings were negatively impacted by the Boeing 737 MAX being grounded for more than seven months bringing a lot of uncertainty and frustration to our customers, our team and our shareholders. We committed then that we would swiftly and aggressively address both of these near-term issues and we've made meaningful progress. First as it relates to our operating reliability, we've seen enormous improvement including the best quarterly operating performance in company history in this past quarter. Robert is going to talk more about this in a minute, but we're incredibly proud of our team and the great work they're doing to take care of our customers and we're running a great operation. Second, on the MAX last quarter we discussed our clear position. The financial cost of the MAX grounding should be borne by Boeing shareholders not American. We're pleased that recently we reached a confidential settlement with Boeing to compensate American for the financial damages we incurred in 2019 due to the grounding of the MAX. While we can't disclose details of the agreement, American shareholders should know that the agreement reflects our priority to ensure our shareholders are adequately compensated with real value for the extended grounding. Of course the settlement only relates to the damages we incurred in 2019 and the MAX is still grounded so we'll continue to hold Boeing accountable for future financial damages to protect our company and our shareholders. Turning now to our 2020 priorities. First, operational excellence. Robert will talk more about this as I said and the ongoing initiatives we have to continue to ensure excellent operating results into the future. But one thing I want to point out is the impact the operation is already having on customer satisfaction. Our goal is to become customers' airline of choice and a measure of -- and as a measure of that we're looking to become the industry leader in customer Likelihood to Recommend scores or LTR. Running our reliable operation is a significant driver of that and our fourth quarter LTR results prove it. In this past quarter, our LTR returned near-record highs and improved year-over-year for the first time since the second quarter of 2018. That gives us great momentum and encouragement for 2020 and beyond. Turning to efficient profitable growth. We now expect to grow American's network by approximately 4% to 5% in 2020. However, annual growth rate estimates don't really tell the story of growth in American in 2020 because our capacity growth will be lower than 4% to 5% until the MAX returns and will be greater than that as the aircraft returns to service. But we're excited about that growth both before and after the return to service date, because it will be efficient and profitable growth. It will be in markets that are expected to produce at/or above average unit revenues largely because the gates we've been able to add in two of our most profitable hubs; Dallas/Fort Worth and Charlotte. It will also be highly efficient growth as it will be funded by the return of some aircraft already included on our cost structure, improved operating reliability and an increase in the gauge of our airplanes. Next in a particular interest to our investors, we are very pleased to have reached a point where we will be generating significant free cash flow. After six years of considerable capital investments in integration and fleet modernization, we're now seeing a significant decline in future CapEx needs and a return on those prior investments. Derek will provide more information on this in a moment but we expect two-year free cash flow to be $6 billion. We believe that free cash flow yield will be a key differentiator between American and our largest competitors going forward and we will keep investors apprised of our progress. This free cash flow will be used to naturally delever our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. We continue to estimate that our total adjusted debt will decline by approximately $3 billion to $4 billion over the next two years and $8 billion to $10 billion over the next five years. So, in summary, we've made real progress in the fourth quarter and we'll apply that same tenacity to 2020. Our team is doing an amazing job of running a reliable operation and taking care of our customers. We have outstanding profitable growth opportunities ahead and we are intent on producing real cash returns for our investors. With that I'll turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. I'd like to start by adding my thanks to the American team for doing a phenomenal job taking care of our customers during the busy holiday travel period. We are pleased with the operation we ran in the fourth quarter and the momentum it gives us to further improve as we head into 2020. During the critical holiday period, we achieved record results for combined mainline and regional on-time departures, on-time arrivals, and completion factor, a fantastic way to end our strongest operational quarter on record. Throughout the spring and summer, reliability and customer service suffered because of exceptionally high aircraft out of service. That's not the case today. Since September, start-of-the-day aircraft out of service has steadily improved reaching best-ever levels in December and through January to-date. On December 24, we had our lowest number of aircraft out of service at the start of the day since the merger with more aircraft available to start the day, more flights departed and arrived on time, with fewer cancellations, and fewer disruptions to our customers' travel flight plans. To add up to Doug's comments about the MAX, we had previously pushed the return to service date to early June. Of course as new information becomes available like earlier this week, we'll reassess that timeline. And to that end, we'll continue to work closely with the FAA, Boeing our pilots and our unions on return-to-service preparation and a new flight schedule. As a reminder, by the end of 2020, we had planned to take delivery of an additional 26 MAX aircraft. We understand from Boeing that 13 of those aircraft have been built and are in storage and we expect most of the remaining aircraft to be delivered by the end of 2020. On the revenue front, we reported record fourth quarter and full year revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was up 3.4% to $11.3 billion. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of unit revenue growth. For the year, our topline grew 2.8% to $45.8 billion. Derek will talk more about our revenue performance in his remarks. Looking at our business today, the revenue environment remains strong and the economy continues to show no signs of slowing down. Importantly, demand for American's product remains robust as our traffic growth continues to outpace GDP growth. Corporate demand remains strong and we're picking up share gap within that segment. This is driven in part by our operational improvement during the quarter, but also by the great work of our global sales and distribution team to drive that business forward. We saw a 28% increase in transactions through NDC-enabled channels during the fourth quarter. This growth is driven by adoption from NDC-connected agencies in both domestic and international points of sale. This is a key component of our goal of being the easiest airline to do business with, so we're excited to see NDC become available to a wider set of customers. Leisure revenue growth was also very strong in the fourth quarter as we delivered a record load factor and we're off to an outstanding start in the New Year. In 2019, our AAdvantage program enrolled the largest number of new members since the merger with the highest year-over-year growth occurring in the fourth quarter. We also ended the year with record numbers of co-brand card members, acquisitions, card spend, and flight redemptions. More members than ever are interacting with American through the enhanced digital experience in their -- of their -- in their AAdvantage accounts. And in 2019, our team delivered even more customer benefits by extending -- by expanding dynamically price redemption opportunities across our network. As Doug mentioned, our operational reliability improved in the fourth quarter and started our Likelihood to Recommend scores. In 2019, we took strides to improve the customer experience in several significant ways. We completed the installation of industry-leading high-speed Wi-Fi across our mainline narrow-body fleet for more than 700 aircraft, giving customers the ability to stay connected from gate to gate. We introduced the A321neo, enhancing what was already the youngest fleet among U.S. network carriers. We expanded the footprint of our industry-leading premium lounge product with new flagship in Admirals Club lounges in -- at DFW and renovated Admirals Clubs in Boston and Pittsburgh. We launched innovative partnerships with Apple, Blade, and the James Beard Foundation and expanded our relationship with Hyatt to improve customers' experience throughout their journeys with us. And we introduced biometric boarding and passport scanning and our mobile app expediting the boarding process on international flights. Of course one of American's biggest competitive advantages is the strength of our network and our ability to grow in our most profitable hubs. We continue to be incredibly pleased with the results from the growth at DFW this past year. In the fourth quarter, we grew DFW capacity by 9% resulting in a 21% increase in origins and destinations. And importantly, this growth came in at above system average passenger unit revenue. We'll continue to see the benefits of this high margin growth at DFW for years to come as we continue to up-gauge the airline. A lot of our growth in 2020 will happen at DFW from the lapping of our expansion there last year and also in Charlotte where we added four new gates in late 2019. We have planned to add three additional gates at Charlotte beginning in 2020 and we'll continue to grow in 2021 with the opening of the new regional concourse at Reagan National as well as the compounding effect of our growth at DFW and Charlotte. On the international side, with full government approval of our joint business with Qantas, customers are already benefiting from new routes and expanded code share and improved frequent flier benefits. In October, we announced new service between DFW and Auckland and Los Angeles and Christchurch starting this year. Our Atlantic Joint Business continues to perform well and it brings significant benefits to customers in North America and Europe. Last month, we announced a new British Airways-operated service between Portland and London, Heathrow, which is one of eight new transatlantic routes starting this summer throughout the Atlantic Joint Business venture. In addition, late last year, we announced plans to co-locate with British Airways at JFK, which will allow us to more efficiently and immediately connect customers traveling across our networks. We're also excited about starting our first-ever service to Africa and Poland in 2020 and returning to Tel Aviv as well. We launched a new reciprocal code share with Royal Air Maroc late last year, which will support our new Philadelphia-Casablanca service and allow for easy connections further into Africa. On January 31, we will stop code sharing with LATAM. American remains the leading carrier and largest carrier between the U.S. and Latin America and the best partner for future relationships. We feel very good about our position in this important region and expect only to grow on our own and with partners in the coming years. And as a result, we don't see any impact to revenue or profitability in 2020. In summary, we made great progress in the fourth quarter, especially in regard to our operations. We have a solid foundation in place and the demand and revenue environment remains strong. The challenges of last year brought us closer as a team, have aligned us in progress and we're excited to deliver on what we've built so far and continue to focus on our operating reliability, improving the customer experience and capitalizing on our valuable growth opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: All right. Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Despite the operational and fleet challenges we faced throughout most of 2019, we're able to grow both pre-tax margins and earnings per share for the third successive quarter and for the year. Our fourth quarter pre-tax profit, excluding net special items of $679 million, resulted in a pre-tax margin of 6% as compared to 5.4% in 2018. The revenue environment continues to be positive, with fourth quarter total revenue growth of 3.4%. Passenger revenues grew by 3.9% to $10.3 billion, a record for the fourth quarter, on unit revenue growth of 0.9 points. For the year, total revenue grew 2.8% to $45.8 billion and was also the highest level of revenue in company history, with total revenue per available seat mile up 1.7%. Robert touched on our international operations, but as we look at our fourth quarter international revenue performance by entity, we continue to see the strength of our Latin American franchise. Latin America was our best-performing entity during the fourth quarter, with a year-over-year unit revenue improvement of 10%, driven by double-digit unit revenue improvements in Brazil and Mexico. We also had positive unit revenue growth in Argentina for the quarter, while Caribbean performance was flat. In the fourth quarter, our Pacific unit revenue continued to show improvement, up 1.3% year-over-year, which was aided by our China restructuring last year and our partnership with Japan Airlines. We saw strength in the Japan market and brought China to positive unit revenue territory. We're executing quickly on our new joint business with Qantas. We recently expanded code share selling to all Qantas and American flights between Australia and New Zealand and the continental U.S., encompassing 104 Qantas and 48 American flights per week during the peak season. Atlantic revenue was up 4.6% on 8.7% more capacity and a decline in unit revenue of 3.7%. The decline in unit revenue is attributed to a foreign exchange headwind and in part due to a potential labor disruption at one of our joint business partners. Underlying premium demand remained strong and we made good progress with premium leisure customers growing this segment by 15% during the quarter. Premium economy continues to do well, as the product matures, with the average fares approximately 2.3 times the coach fare. Domestic revenue grew 4.4% from strong load factors, offset in part by weaker yields during the pre-Thanksgiving travel period, which led to somewhat flat unit revenue production during the quarter. Investors shouldn't read too much into the softness we saw in November, as December closed out very strong and those trends have continued into January. On the cargo front, trade concerns and macro weakness outside the United States continued to weigh on both cargo volumes and yields. When combined with year-over-year international schedule reductions we made in the fourth quarter of 2018, cargo revenues fell 18.3% to $216 million in the fourth quarter. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter were up 2.1% at $10.6 billion. When fuel and special items are excluded, our unit cost increased in the fourth quarter by 2% compared to 2018, due primarily to higher salaries and benefits, maintenance and regional expenses. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.1 billion in total available liquidity. As we noted on our January 10 investor update, due to the uncertainty of the return of service of the MAX and our commitment to our $7 billion liquidity target, we arranged an additional revolving line of credit to provide the company with increased borrowing capacity of up to $400 million. We don't have any present intention to borrow any amounts under this facility, which matures in September 2020, with an optional extension to December 2020. During the fourth quarter we paid dividends of $44 million and repurchased approximately $285 million of stock, or 9.9 million shares. We have begun to delever the balance sheet, as our CapEx requirements have come down. As a result, our year-end adjusted debt position decreased by $1.5 billion year-over-year. Before we turn to guidance, I'd like to talk about the changes we made to the format of our investor update. Due to material uncertainty around the grounding of the MAX, we are adjusting how we provide our forward-looking guidance. Going forward, we will provide guidance on the current quarter and the full year only. As we look at 2020, with the MAX grounding in mind, we currently project our earnings will be negatively affected by substantially the same amount as our 2019 earnings were impacted. While we expect Boeing to compensate us for these 2020 losses, this compensation is not included in any of our forward guidance. As Doug mentioned, we now expect that our 2020 capacity growth will be approximately 4% to 5% and that our CASM --2020 CASM growth, excluding fuel special items and new labor deals will be up approximately 1%. However, because our annual metrics like capacity and unit costs are highly sensitive to our MAX return assumptions, it's worth pointing out that these metrics will have a different trajectory in the second half of 2020 than what we are guiding in the first quarter. As such, our CASM will be up 2% to 4% in the first quarter. And when the MAX returns later in the year, our capacity will be higher and our CASM is expected to be down year-over-year. Looking forward, despite the geopolitical headlines, we continue to see no signs of macro softness in our forward bookings. We expect first quarter domestic demand to remain robust and LATAM to again be the best-performing international entity. With that backdrop, we forecast our first quarter year-over-year TRASM to be flat to up 2%. We also expect that our first quarter pretax margin excluding net special items will be roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. Based on the assumptions I referenced earlier, we believe, our full year earnings per diluted share excluding net special items will be between $4 and $6 a share. In 2019, we made contributions of more than $1.2 billion to our defined benefit pension plans or $436 million in excess of required contributions, prefunding a portion of our 2020 minimum required contribution. Favorable asset performance of 23.5%, coupled with significant company contributions helped to offset an increase in the benefit obligation due to declining interest rates, improving funded status by four percentage points. For 2020, we intend to make a total contribution of $193 million. We also expect a significant reduction in pension expense year-over-year by approximately $260 million. Our total projected capital expenditures for 2020 is expected to be $3.3 billion, comprised of $1.7 billion in non-aircraft CapEx and $1.6 billion in aircraft CapEx. With these capital numbers, as Doug said, we currently forecast that we will generate $6 billion in free cash flow over the next two years. So with that, I will turn it back over to the operator to begin our question-and-answer session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, two questions here and maybe, this is to Derek. I realize that you mentioned with the guidance that it doesn't reflect any sort of benefit from Boeing. But I want to touch on that $6 billion of free cash flow over the next two years because, in the Southwest press release, they did call out $400 million of supplier proceeds that they received in 2019. So, you were talking about the forward guidance. I want to be clear. Does your 2019 number include any sort of benefit, cash benefit from Boeing? And if not, is that potential upside to the $6 billion over the next two years? Anything you can say on that would be great. Thanks.\nDerek Kerr: It's hard to talk about any of this because it's a confidential settlement that's out there today. The impact in '20 and '21 where -- is in there from a settlement perspective. But we can't really talk about how we got the settlement and where we got it. We got it over time after things and that's kind of where we are Mike. It's really just because it's a deal with Boeing that we have and it's confidential that we can't really outline where that's at. But it will -- the Boeing settlement for the $6 billion that we talked about is included in those numbers, so there's no change to that. No upside to that number because of the Boeing settlement unless we talk about a 2020 settlement that's out there that we have not talked about at all. So I guess there's some upside if there's a Boeing settlement on 2020. But I think the '20 -- the settlement we already have is included in that $6 billion number.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. That's actually very helpful. And then just my second question, you haven't made recently any change to your bag fees, what you charge for bag fees. Have you -- I just -- I haven't been able to check.\nDerek Kerr: We have not.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. So, question on cost. Your better-than-expected fourth quarter cost performance is due to running a better operation. You talked about some of the milestones you hit on aircraft out of service during the quarter. So, have you extrapolated these better trends into your 2020 CASM guide? Or did you build it on any cushion from an operational performance standpoint? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nDerek Kerr: We have an ASM guide at 4% to 6%, so we have assumed a completion factor of 4% to 5%, excuse me. And we have built in a completion factor that we assume that we continue to run the operation that we have today. So that is in play there. From a CASM perspective, for the full year, the one big headwind that we have is in the maintenance area and it's mostly in engine cost. And some of that is driven by keeping some of the older aircraft around and doing engine hauls on those aircraft -- engine overhauls on those aircraft, due to the fact that the uncertainty on the MAX and some of the delays on the 321 aircraft. So, we have extrapolated in the operation is going to be better. And we have -- but we have -- one of the biggest headwinds is just the maintenance side of things from a cost perspective.\nDoug Parker: Hey Kate, this is Doug and I'll just add to that. Again, much like we said that the ASM numbers for the year don't really reflect our plan for the entire year because, again that 4% to 5% will be lower than that before the MAX returns and higher than after. The same holds true for CASM. So, that number can move as return to service dates move. But know this once the return to service date is here, the CASM will be lower than that average number Derek gave. And until it does, they will be somewhat higher than that.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Understood. And then a question on the $6 billion in free cash flow you're expecting over the next few years. So approximately how much of that is from sale leaseback proceeds? I know in 2020 that number is $1.5 billion. But what's that figure for 2021? Thank you.\nDerek Kerr: Right now it's zero for 2021.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Thank you.\nDerek Kerr: $1.5 billion is correct for 2020. Zero for 2021.\nCatherine O'Brien: Appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jose Caiado with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJose Caiado: Hey, thank you very much. Good morning. Robert maybe a question for you. I wanted to ask about the progress on your sub-fleet optimization initiative. I believe you were hoping to take something like 50-or-so different sub fleet combos down to 30 or so. Can you just give us an update on that initiative? I imagine the MAX situation last year maybe delayed the progress there and just how you're thinking about that for 2020.\nRobert Isom: Sure. So one of our big projects on the mainline side was to make the configurations on our 321s and our 737 fleets identical. So because of the issues that we ran into last year, of course with the MAX and aircraft out of service we slowed that project down. So to date we plan on reconfiguring a total 304 737s. And I believe that we're \u2013 it changes daily but I believe that we're 80 or so through that. We've just started on the 321s the 202-or-so aircraft there. So there's a lot more that is coming there. Recall that those configurations not only did they standardize not only did they also add to the total seat count but they also brought great customer amenities such as new lighting, new seats, oversized bins, satellite WiFi and whatnot. So we're really excited about that and getting great feedback from customers on that. We still have in our plan to eliminate the E190s by the end of the summer. The Super 80s are gone. The 767s will be gone next year. And on the regional side we've done a great job in terms of both rationalizing our fleets in terms of different configurations and also carry partner carriers as well greatly simplifying things. So we're really excited about where we've \u2013 where we started. There's still a lot of upside though as we move forward, especially on the mainline side of things.\nJose Caiado: Thank you for that. And then just a quick second question on your load factor initiatives in 2019. Generally were you pretty satisfied with how the initiative sort of played out? And do you have any plans to make any adjustments to that strategy in 2020? Thanks so much for the time.\nDon Casey: Okay. This is Don. Actually we're very, very pleased with how well we executed on our \u2013 what we described as kind of the smartly go load factor, because obviously our objective is not to maximize load factor but to maximize revenue. And we had over the course of 2019 issued record load factors. It was the highest load factor the company has ever had in its history. And as we look at where we grew because that's really the most important part, we were able to find the right places in order to be able to push the load factor out. As we look forward into 2020, we still think there is a little bit of opportunity as we look back to fine-tune what we did in 2019. So I think a bit more upside going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. First one for Derek a similar question, well actually identical to what I asked from United yesterday. Could you talk about the evolution of the $4 to $6 guide and the timing of when that forecast really did come together, the degree to which it was influenced by some of the recent geopolitical uncertainty? Also clearly a foregoing conclusion that you're going to have to push the June reentry schedule, should we anticipate updated annual metrics when that happens?\nDoug Parker: Jamie I'll take that on a broad one. If you need more Derek can give you more example. And to your question when was it \u2013 when do we come that it was last night. So it incorporates everything we know at this point in time, everything we anticipate at this point in time. And our \u2013 certainly our objective is not to amend it other than to maybe be amending it upwards we had hoped maybe at some point in time. Because everything we see right now are really what we anticipate right now. And to the extent that changes of course we would update it at that time. But anything we know now is in there. And to the extent unanticipated issues come up we'll work very hard to offset those, so we don't have to adjust it. But it's \u2013 all those things you mentioned are incorporated in that.\nJamie Baker: And just to drill down no accruals for any \u2013 no unique contract assumptions that are in the guide.\nDoug Parker: I'm sorry.\nJamie Baker: No labor accruals or assumptions on your behalf as part of the guide just want to make sure.\nDoug Parker: Yes. I want to make sure I said it's right again. It includes everything we anticipate at this time. We know where we are in labor negotiations. What we anticipate is included in that so...\nJamie Baker: Okay. Excellent. And a follow-up on labor Doug. I wanted to ask about the bench. I was impressed to see the hire of Brian on Vasu's team. I think there has been some surprise amongst investors that there haven't been, how should I say this more gyrations in terms of the overall bench. I want to ask the question in a way that you're comfortable asking or answering, excuse me. You could answer my question with a question if you want. I guess I'll ask it this way. Was Brian a one-off? Or would you say that you are actively looking to pick up new talent where needed throughout the organization?\nDoug Parker: Yeah. We're always actively looking to pick-up new talent throughout the organization. We've been doing so for quite some time. That's one case. There have been several over the years, and they've been some of the best additions to the team. It's one of the really nice things actually from my perspective of the transformation that's happened. American and in this industry, there was a time it was difficult to attract good people that are -- that were already in the business. But we've -- who we are and what we can do now, I mean might get us -- just look at -- if you -- you apparently haven't or we haven't been prominent enough in pointing out to you the kinds of people we have been adding such as our General Counsel with a phenomenal resume in the division. We have people we've added over the last two years from firms like this, memory now, IBM, PepsiCo, Walmart, JPMorgan, Starwood, Texas Instruments, that have all come to this organization and had made a huge difference, and we'll continue to do so. So we'll keep doing that, and we do it throughout the organization. Those people are all throughout the organization. We feel fantastic about the team we have in place, the structure we have in place, and the bench strength we have in place. We're -- what we -- but we always are looking to improve. And are -- as you know, we're excited about the hire as you noted, and there are more to come as there always will be and really excited about we have in place.\nJamie Baker: Excellent. Strong answer. Thank you, Doug. Take care.\nDoug Parker: Thanks. Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDoug Parker: Hi, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: Hey. Hey, Doug, everybody. Doug, a bit of an offbeat question, but the way you were talking about the shareholders sort of feeling the impact of the MAX delays in your prepared remarks, it kind of just dawned on me. It wouldn't one way to soften that might be cutting a special dividend of about $5 per share to your shareholders using Boeing money to make up for how much your stock price has gone down since the MAX was grounded? Is that something you would consider?\nDoug Parker: Jamie, here's how we think about -- I'm sorry -- every time. I swear I'm not doing it for -- I swear I'm not doing it for. \nHunter Keay: Every time.\nDoug Parker: All right. All right -- right now. But I do it to each one of you. So anyway, Hunter, sorry. Look this -- we view this settlement as we do all cash proceeds and cash flow generated by the company it goes in order. First to invest in the business make sure we're doing that. Next to make sure we're paying down any debt either that is expensive, which we don't have any of that or as it comes due and we don't need to add more to do that. And then having done those things invest in the company and make sure we're paying down debt as prudent. And then make sure we have sufficient amount on hand to ensure that we have -- as we do an extremely large cash balance ought to be prepared to be ready for any sort of black swan event that might happen. So we make sure we always have at least $7 billion of liquidity in hand. So you know all that. And then having done all that the excess, we do look to return to shareholders. We've been aggressive about that in the past. We'll be in the future. We believe with where the stock is -- when we believe the stock is undervalued, we think the best way to return that to the shareholders is to repurchase some shares. From those who are not as -- we're not as -- don't have as much of a strong view on the future as others might. We think that's the best way to return to shareholders not through dividends. So that's how we'll treat these proceeds as well.\nHunter Keay: Okay. That's fair. Thanks. And then, as I look at the headcount over the last few years, I'm curious Derek how attrition rates have impacted that relative to what your baseline plan was at the time of the merger. Obviously labor rates have gone up. And folks who don't have mandatory retirement ages, are probably hanging on a little bit longer to make up for lost pensions and things like that. So how has attrition impacted headcount? And is that something -- is that an area that's been a little bit worse than expected relative to your baseline sort of merger cost outlook? And is there anything that can be done about that going forward? Thanks.\nDerek Kerr: I wouldn't say it's any -- we're different than what's expected. I mean from attrition rates have definitely gone down because of the salaries within the industry. So at certain areas where there were high attrition, it's gone down a fair amount. But we're managing that. That just means we're not hiring as many people in those areas than we have. So I'm not concerned about where we're at. I think we're efficient. We're going to become more efficient over time. There might be some opportunities that we will go after over the next few years. But as we go forward, I think we look at that all the time. But attrition really hasn't impacted it. That's really lowered hiring and lowered where we needed to be from a hiring standpoint.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Good morning. Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Hey, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just revisiting the fourth quarter a little bit and I apologize if this is overly simplistic. But you grew below 3% you had the benefit of Dallas hub growth. Competitors had fleet limitations, which limited their ability to grow and inflated their non-fuel costs. You were in a seasonally stronger period and yet revenue came in softer versus your initial guide. And so, again maybe overly simplistic, but if you can't find price on 3% growth, how are investors supposed to get comfortable that you can find it on 5-plus to offset inflationary pressures on the business longer term? And more importantly, how are you going to evaluate if that aspirational growth rate is working as we proceed maybe in the back half of this year?\nDon Casey: Okay. This is \u2013 Duane, this is Don Casey talking. So if you could just look at kind of what our guide was our guide was to have TRASM up, I think at 1 point in the fourth quarter. We ended up 0.5 point. Two-tenths of that was we had more ASMs in the quarter because of better completion factor. We're down about three-tenths. When you do look at the numbers that we have, you have to remember this is the kind of the last quarter, but we have this headwind related to frequent flyer recognition is about nine-tenths a point. So when you kind of back that and look at our numbers, we actually did I think pretty well relative to everybody else. Probably more importantly is as we look forward into the second quarter, particularly in the domestic market, we actually see the domestic market looking pretty robust as we head forward \u2013 look forward. So in every forward month right now our yields, which were a bit soft in the fourth quarter, because of the performance in November all look positive, right? So we're pretty actually optimistic about our forward outlook. And again, as you think about the fourth quarter really the only thing that was off track for us was November. We did better in December than we expected. We did better in October than we expected. But November with the extra week of trough that last week before Thanksgiving for us was very, very weak. But beyond that, everything really performed really at or above expectations. And again, the forward look in terms of forward deals is positive.\nDoug Parker: And Bob on the growth...\nVasu Raja: Yeah. Hey, Duane, this is Vasu. I'll just add something to Don's comments too in that the manner in which we've taken out the MAX in the past and the way we're taking it out in the first quarter and second quarter is different, right? Until this point in time certainly in fourth quarter and third quarter before that we were taking the MAX out sometimes 60 or 75 days before the flights flew. So, what we are effectively doing is we had already filled up capacity and we had fewer seats available for higher-yielding last-minute bookings. And so you can see it certainly stands to reason. You see it in the industry data that there has been a huge transfer of share from carriers that operate the MAX to carriers that don't operate the MAX and we saw that in the fourth quarter. But despite that as we look forward, we have been \u2013 actually, we've taken it out further in advance. And so that enables us to go and revenue manage the airline to a more predictable capacity base. But also in fourth quarter, despite the very obvious frustrations we have with the MAX one thing that is encouraging as we think about bringing the MAX back is as we took the MAX out we sought to preserve the connecting power of our three biggest hubs; Chicago, DFW and Charlotte. And so even though we saw net traffic loss across our system in those three hubs we actually both saw traffic gain. And most critically, we saw share gains of the highest value O&Ds in the domestic system. This is encouraging to us of course, because when the MAX comes back, the marginal cost of bringing that airplane back is miniscule. Indeed, we're carrying it right now. But we believe the marginal RASMs will be certainly uniquely high for us, because so much of what the MAX will do is provide more seats on those higher-value O&Ds that are at the highest percentiles of our domestic yield curves.\nDon Casey: Yeah. This is Don again. Just add one more point. If you look at where the MAX capacity effect is it's really domestic. That's where we actually have the impact. It grew domestically only by 1.2% in the fourth quarter. We expect it to grow a lot more. And domestic has the far and away the highest nominal PRASMs, so it hasn't taken important impact on us in terms of fourth quarter unit revenue.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks for that detail. And just for a quick follow-up Derek, the lower pension expense ratable across the quarters. And would you be willing to disclose the actual pension expense in 2020 versus 2019? Thanks for taking the questions.\nDerek Kerr: It is ratable throughout the quarters. And the 260 number is the number that is going to be the expense this year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Doug, I guess given that this is the start of a new year, I just wanted to ask you a bigger-picture question. And then, I don't mean to be combative but since 2014 the first year following the merger your pre-tax income has declined by about 30%, a little over $1 billion. I know the MAX creates some hardship, but United and Southwest who are both MAX operators have grown pre-tax over that period. Neither one of those carriers has a significantly larger operational footprint than you, and neither has a single hub that's bigger than either of your two largest at DFW and Charlotte as they currently exist. So I guess the question with all respect and without reference to the MAX or the need for more capacity, what do you think the one to two things are that you've done wrong since the merger? And what are the one or two things that you think you need to do differently in 2020 to show investors that you can reverse the downward earnings trend?\nDoug Parker: Yeah. Let me \u2013 let me answer it this way by \u2013 first by noting \u2013 look one, we agree. We know of course that \u2013 let's just talk about this as the margin gap. We fully recognize that our relative \u2013 our margins relative to our two largest competitors have \u2013 that gap has gone from being positive to American to negative to American or to the extent it was positive \u2013 if Delta was positive, which was more positive of late. And we're concerned about that and certainly intent on reversing the trend. Further to explain most of what you described from 2014 on part of our large margin relative margin performance was the fact that as we took two airlines one US Airways, which has lower labor costs than the big three; and then American which has lower labor costs than those two airlines as it went through a bankruptcy, a large part of that margin advantage was unsustainable. We certainly \u2013 I think we're quite clear about that at the time that we were going to need to overtime as we sign new contracts get our teams wages and benefits in line with those and that's happened. So that's certainly a part of it. But that's not \u2013 but having said that, that's not always what we're going on. So let me just say it this way. As we sit here today having just closed these years out that gap, I mean, I don't know what \u2013 what the line you look at, I don\u2019t know generally people look at pre-tax we get somewhat hurt on that of course, but the fact that we've gone and invested in $20 billion of new aircraft for the last five years that those airlines haven't done yet. So that's about a point of it. So a way to adjust for that is to look -- but anyway the trends are much the same. I'm not trying to blame it on that. But I think a better way to look at it is with the EBITDAR margin. And again the story is exactly the same. You look at the EBITDAR margins for the year just ended we're going to -- we come out a little less than two points behind United for the year and about six points behind Delta. So I look at those and think that doesn't seem right. We should -- there's no reason that American Airlines should have margins that are lower than United. There may be a structural reason at this point in time that we would be lower than Delta as United is. That structural reason being that they had so much of their capacity flying in and out of really, really profitable hubs. But we're not -- I'm not trying to say that there's some structural reason that can't be closed but it may not be able to be closed in the really near-term. As we end up growing Dallas and Charlotte over time in our network I think that can be closed. But I suspect you're talking more near-term. So in the near-term here's what I think. We have one more of these contracts to do. That's in -- that's one more to actually get our labor costs in line. We have one more joint collective bargain agreement to get done. That will happen in 2020. Once we do that you will then be at a point where our labor costs in general across the border largely in line with theirs so you won't see that continued kind of pressure. So, as we look to 2020 we have that headwind, but what I believe is because of all the things we have going on that we'll close that gap. The 2020 margin again, let's set the MAX side for whatever that does to this year's earnings what we will then be compensated for. But just looking at adjusted for the MAX, I think, our margins this year will be despite that headwind in line or hopefully maybe in a little better than those two carriers. Year-over-year improvement I'm saying. So while we may not be able to start closing it in 2020 because we have to get that last contract there within there and having done that we will then have labor costs that are now largely the same as our competitors. Well to the extent labor costs go up at any of our airlines it will go up at all of the airlines at a better or similar amount. So -- and as that happens, I think, right now is we expect that margin gap to be closed. How much how fast? Hard to say. Conservatively, I think, we should easily be able to get one point here. So again let's for 2020 assume that we not only get that point, but we stay where we are in the gap. And then a couple more years we're at or near United and then -- and then over three years ahead of United and -- or by one point or so and closing that and having that gap and half again still. That's -- that I believe is what you'll see from us from all the initiatives that we've been laying out over time. They're working now. Despite all that is going on and the headwinds we've had we did indeed have margin expansion year-over-year. We had this quarter our fourth quarter margin improvement for the first time in two years was -- didn't that -- the improvement was better than United for the first time in two years. I don't want to make a big deal about that because it's not that much but it's not that much improved and it's one quarter and it's the last quarter of the year so -- who knows. But that's a fact. It was the first time in two years that we've seen our margin gap versus United start to narrow albeit at a small rate. We hope that's the beginning of a trend. Certainly, I think, that should be -- like I say once we get this last contract in place going forward. So that's where we're headed. That happens by the way without -- if you ask me, what do we need to do about that? I believe we've been -- I believe we explained all that. Again if you want more Robert and Don can do it again. It's largely revenue and its revenue initiatives things like getting our -- the entire fleet harmonized things like getting our ability to sell up in the same position than some of our competitors are things that we know we can and will do and it will allow our revenues to increase at a rate or again our revenues to increase at a rate and our profits to increase at a rate that they don't have the opportunity to do. So that's what I think. I know it's a long answer but it's a really important question that we get a lot and that's what I believe. It's -- that margin gap is not something we believe is acceptable, not something we believe will be sustained and one that you should continue to hold our feet to the fire as we move forward.\nDarryl Genovesi: Great. Thank you very much Doug for the answer.\nDoug Parker: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. Thanks. Doug I just want to highlight that. I mean you do refer to kind of the competitive disadvantage that you face in some cases. You guys have an enormous competitive advantage over United in particular related to the credit card program. That I think needs to be considered. But my question is, when you look out over the next couple of years in the $6 billion in free cash flow how much of that do you expect to return to shareholders versus going to pay down debt or the pension? Like what's the actual number that you see being free to return?\nDoug Parker: Yes. Before I answer that I just want to respond to your comment. Nothing that I said we have disadvantages to United nothing. We're not saying any reason that we think we shouldn't have margins at or better than United. And I agree with you our credit card program is an advantage. That's one of the reasons that there shouldn't -- what I said was we may have a structural disadvantage on the network front versus Delta today. So anyway that's what I tried to say. The -- as to your question on how much of that free cash flow gets to investors I'll refer back to my comments which were as follows. We said that we expect over the next two years free cash flow of $6 billion. And we also said that we expected to reduce our total adjusted debt by $3 billion to $4 billion. Again, so that's -- there's a couple of billion dollars there. And again all else equal would be excess of the $7 billion. And with -- again consistent with our past behavior and our views about our obligation to our shareholders, I would expect if I was modeling that that would be returned to shareholders.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then if the MAX reduced 2019 pretax by $550 million, the mechanics was another few hundred million. Can you just help us understand how much of an impact that's expected to be in 2020? If things are getting better and the operation is getting better and there's revenue momentum then why shouldn't the baseline for 2020 be 2019 results plus the MAX and the mechanics impacts? I guess how much of those factors are reduced? How much are those reducing the first quarter 2020 guidance by? Can you just maybe help us understand that? Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Yes, sure. Yes, thanks. Look the MAX is still an issue in 2020. So -- and when we say we expect to be back, obviously we have our June date and -- but that we're going to need to reassess that. So some time late summer early fall, let's assume that's going to be at about the same number of months in 2020 as it was in 2019. So the MAX effect on financials, there's no positive impact in those numbers. I do want to make this -- take the time to make this point, whatever that amount is we will be compensated. That -- Boeing has been clear about that. They've shown that they're -- they will do that. It is unfortunate that the accounting for that doesn't match the period in which the pain happens. But it's real value. It's value that accrues to our shareholders and we are committed to ensuring that we receive that value for you on your behalf on our behalf. So that -- again those -- I would just ask all of you as you look to those kind of large impacts of the Boeing impact to understand that those are -- that's an accounting issue in large part, at least again for financial purposes. It's a huge obviously issue for our customers and our team. But other than that, as it relates to the financials, that amount our shareholders will be compensated for. It just won't be -- it just won't be accounted for in the current period. Point one. So that's my answers to how much is the MAX. So that leaves you with the other piece, which is the operating issues we had this year. Certainly, there's upside to that. We -- as I mentioned, we have some -- we have another headwind which is the contract which caused -- the contract negotiations which were related to that issue will result in -- what we really want to get happen make happen with this contract for our fleet service and maintenance team. That will lead to an increase in our costs. So on a year-over-year basis I think those things certainly don't have a huge positive. It's certainly not a positive impact. I'll say it's one versus the other. But having said all that, I go back to where -- what we said which is knowing everything we know at this point we gave you an EPS estimate that we believe is our best estimate of where we are at this point incorporating all.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Parker: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.\nDoug Parker: Thank you.\nDan McKenzie: Yeah. Thanks for the time guys. With respect to the $7 billion liquidity target, what's the debt profile that you'd like to see before you draw that down? So if there's $3 billion to $4 billion less debt in two years, what liquidity target might accompany that?\nDoug Parker: Yes, it's a good question, Dan. I don't have all the answers specifically, but you raised a good point. That number is based upon -- we work with -- again there is science, but at the end of the day it's -- there's some art as well. But the science is going and working with some outside investment bankers and running all sorts kind of Monte Carlo simulation worst case make sure under any sort of difficult situation that we have more than enough to handle that. Those simulations run with less debt will result in a lower cash balance required. They're not doing it yet. When they do, we'll continue to look at it. But it's a fair -- but anyway, you raise a good point. I look forward to the day that that's the question we're getting from all of our shareholders which is \"Why are you holding so much of the cash.\" But right now, we believe it's prudent. But there will -- I certainly expect as we produce the kind of cash flow we suggested and use it to pay down debt that there will come a time in the future that we'll -- that number will come down somewhat.\nDan McKenzie: Understood. Okay.\nDoug Parker: Thanks.\nDan McKenzie: Sure. And then next question here, Don or Vasu, I think you've been really clear that the growth is focused where you're strong. But as you look at where you're strong, you look at where you're weak, how do you get more critical mass in the markets where you're weak? So I guess the question is, could an expanded codeshare domestically be a good solution? And then kind of separate to that question, I'm just wondering just given the Atlantic RASM headwind, I'm just wondering if you could just -- as a housecleaning question just sort of comment on when you think that that might reverse?\nVasu Raja: Hey, Dan, this is Vasu. Let me start and then Don and others can pick up. Actually let me take the second question first and then I'll do the first one. So there's certainly a foreign exchange impact in fourth quarter transatlantic RASM. But one of the things -- and we've talked about this for a long time. Certainly, I have is that as we go and shrink the number of subfleets, we're turning 767s into 787s. So in the old days of both AMR and US Airways, we could go into the winters when demand was lower and simply idle wide-bodies or widen in the domestic system or things like that. The ownership of those things was very different. So one of the things which we've been doing increasingly is going and extending fourth quarter flying on our wide-bodies. And the RASMs are down. We've been really pleased with the marginal earnings from it, right? Of course, we -- the cost of operating a 787 flying Chicago to Barcelona in the winter is maybe -- it's very, very small respectively just the incremental cost of the fuel burn on the thing. But what we're seeing on it are marginal RASMs that are in the 75% to 80% range of or otherwise flying in transatlantic. And so that's been a really positive development for us. Indeed over time not that long ago the airline didn't make money flying transatlantic in the winter and now we make money transatlantic all 12 months of the year and we see opportunities to go and do more. And so though we see this near-term RASM challenge is backed up by something, which is a really promising sign for future earnings and future network development. And then to your earlier point about places where we're relatively strong or relatively weaker. Look it remains to be seen. The more critical point is that in the places where we're strong and certainly in markets like in the Midwest, the Southeast, Florida things like that the Southwest, we -- every chance we've had to grow it we have been seeing that the marginal earnings off of that growth has been really attractive. Indeed it -- though it is obscured with any number of other things going on we see opportunities to be able to grow earnings primarily by being able to do that organically in the near term.\nDon Casey: This is Don. I'll just talk just about the Atlantic. Just the way our joint business kind of we settle out revenues at the end of the year, we didn't have a three-point headwind on the Atlantic, which we can not really relate it to the kind of performance. You back that out our performance is basically right in line with Delta and United. So I think we're all seeing the same thing which is a pretty stable business demand and demand for premium products that have pretty aggressive pricing at this point in the coacher.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. Yeah. Thanks for the time.\nDoug Parker: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Your line is now open.\nAlison Sider: Hi. Thanks so much.\nDoug Parker: Hi, Ali.\nAlison Sider: I was wondering if you could share if there's any sort of thinking that you have right now? I know there's a lot of uncertainty, but any contingency plans for a much longer-term grounding? If this were to continue past mid-year through the end of the year or even longer kind of what kind of things would you do differently? Does that feel like it's a possibility? Is it something you're kind of gaming out already?\nDoug Parker: Ali, we aren't at this point. We are running our airline today without the MAX in service. And if we're going to be out longer than we anticipate we will continue to do the same things. We're not going to have our strategy dictated by when this airplane comes or doesn't come. We know it will fly again someday. When it does we'll be ready. In the meantime, we're going to keep focusing on running a great operation making sure that where we are growing that we're growing where we can be profitable, and making sure we're generating some free cash flow. But when the FAA side of the aircraft is ready to fly, we'll be ready -- we will make -- we'll be ready to get our pods training at the aircraft back up. We're looking forward to that. But until that time, we'll keep doing exactly what we're doing. And don't have any plans beyond trying to figure out what happens after that or before that.\nAlison Sider: Got it. Thanks. And do you expect a simulator training requirement to sort of create a lot of new delays or slow down the return to service process when it eventually comes?\nDoug Parker: Go ahead, Rob.\nRobert Isom: Yeah. We're working really closely with the FAA in trying to make sure that there's all the information is built into our planning. From what we know right now we know that there's going to be simulator -- 737 MAX simulator training required. We are sketching out a number of different scenarios. And in all of those we've made sure that American is sufficiently staffed with resources simulators, and also training resources to make sure that we can get the aircraft back up as soon as possible once the FAA and once our pilots and Boeing say the aircraft ready to go.\nAlison Sider: Thanks.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Ali.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Your line is now open.\nDoug Parker: Hi, Dawn.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi. Hey, how are you? My question has to do with the coronavirus, but are kind of on three fronts. I know it's early, but are you guys seeing any booking impact at all? Have you contemplated any travel waivers for the region? And lastly, maybe this one is for Robert. What measures is American taking to protect passengers and crew?\nRobert Isom: Thanks Dawn. So first off, we haven't -- it's too soon to see any impact. Our network isn't that extensive in Asia. But we're on top of it. We're working with CBP, the CDC and public health officials as well as our medical resources here to make sure that we're following all best practices. We're doing that with an intent to make sure that we take care of our customers and team members. We've seen viruses in the past that we've had to make accommodations for and to be prepared for. We're doing all those same things right now. And we're going to watch it and make sure that we take aggressive action if there is a need to.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Your line is now open.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi. Good morning everybody. On the MAX, how has the grounding affected your hiring plans for this year and going forward? And when do you expect to be fully over the issues with the MAX considering or thinking if Boeing's forecast for midyear FAA ground lifting holds? Thanks.\nRobert Isom: So, we know -- we're confident that the MAX will come back. And we plan for the future. And as we take a look out into that future and where we will be later in 2020, assuming the aircraft comes back in late summer or early fall or even out into 2021. We are planning and making sure that we're ready to accommodate those aircraft. The planning cycle for pilots is a lengthy one. And so we actually have to start hiring 12 months or more in advance. Not only to handle growth, but also to handle the hundreds of pilots that are, now retiring out of American. We feel really good about that pilot pipeline. We're going to make its -- our pilots are our best asset. And we do a great job in going out and hiring and recruiting the best of the best and making sure that they're always trained and ready to go. So, we're planning well in advance. We have sufficient number of pilots. And right now we're not making any changes to that plan.\nLeslie Josephs: Thanks. And then, the other question is about the hold MAX issue. When do you expect to have your 76? Has Boeing given you any guidance on that? And when do you expect this whole thing to resolve? Does Boeing forecast for the grounding is lifted in the middle of the year. And you have the plane by let's say like late summer, early fall?\nRobert Isom: So right now, all we can tell you is that we know that we have 24 owned aircraft. And that once the ungrounding is lifted we're ready to go with those. As I mentioned, there's a number of aircraft that have also been produced. We're hopeful that those would be some of the first that could be released. But then in terms of future production, we don't know. And so, we'll continue to work very closely with Boeing, once the aircraft is ungrounded. And we're hopeful to get delivery and back to the levels of flying that we had intended originally.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thanks. And then, so, no reduction in hiring of pilots or cabin crews, because of the MAX issues?\nRobert Isom: No.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Slotnick with Business Insider. Your line is now open.\nDavid Slotnick: Hi. How are you? Thanks for taking my question. I know that you have resolved the worst part of the labor issues that you were experiencing last spring and into the summer. I just wondered if you had any update on contract negotiations with mechanics and pilot teams.\nDoug Parker: They continue. The National Mediation Board is overseeing those negotiations. We recently restarted again after the New Year. They continue. And that's the update. The -- we have -- all parties have agreed at the NMB's request not to discuss those negotiations. Other than that -- and that's been productive thus far so we'll abide by that.\nDavid Slotnick: Got you, thanks and just quickly, I know you were talking about the partnership and codeshare Qantas earlier. Have you seen any impact because of the fires? Or has it really been too soon for that?\nRobert Isom: Don, do you want to talk about that?\nDon Casey: Yeah, yeah, so we have started. We've expanded the codeshare with Qantas. So right now I think it's still in the early stages. In terms of performance, obviously, we when we look at the Australian market, we've seen over the last -- really started about three weeks ago a bit of a softening in terms of U.S. demand. But overall, I think, we're very happy with the progress, we're making with Qantas right now.\nDavid Slotnick: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Edward Russell with The Points Guy. Your line is now open.\nEdward Russell: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the fleet plans with the continued MAX grounding. I see, you're continuing with the E190 retirements. And I don't see any other modifications to the fleet plan to address the fact that the MAXs won't be back in the sky until at least the summer. Is American considering holding on to the 190s? Or any other measures to make sure that you can continue to grow to the MAX?\nRobert Isom: Edward, right now the 190s are scheduled to go out at the end of the summer. That's the game plan. That's the way we've built the airline. We will make adjustments based on what we hear from Boeing and the actual time lines as they become more firm. But right now, we anticipate the MAX coming back late summer, early fall. And we're preparing our airline to that end.\nEdward Russell: Okay. And is it also correct then since the retrofits of the 321s and the 737s are going to move forward this -- in the new this year on schedule? I know they were postponed last year due to the MAX.\nRobert Isom: Yeah. So from the original schedule, we're probably a year behind. But as we take a look into the year we will have -- we restarted the 737 line. We have the 321 prototype done as well. And we will have a critical mass. I don't know the exact number that we'll have done by next summer, but, its 115...\nDon Casey: All the 738s will be done by April of 2021. And then all the 321s will be done by May of 2022. And we're going to keep the line going at the entire time. We're not going to pull the line because of the delay in the MAXs this year. We're going to keep it moving.\nEdward Russell: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Doug Parker for any closing remarks.\nDoug Parker: Thank you all very much. We appreciate your interest. And if you have any questions please let us know. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "AAL", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-10-24 16:04:10", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 American Airlines Group, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Dan Cravens. Sir, you may begin.\nDan Cravens: Thank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us in the room this morning is Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for our question-and-answer session are several of our senior execs, including Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications, Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management; as well as Vasu Raja, our Senior Vice President of Network Strategy. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results. Robert will then following with commentary on operational performance and our commercial activities for our 2019 and 2020. Derek will then walk us through the details on the third quarter and provide us some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year and some preliminary guidance for 2020. And then after we hear from those comments, we will open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today\u2019s call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans, and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on the website, the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us this morning. At this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thanks Dan, good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. Today we announced pre-tax earnings excluding special items of $835 million or $1.42 per share, that\u2019s a 16% increase in year-over-year pre-tax earnings and a 20% increase in EPS. But we know these earnings and the increase in earnings should have been even better. Our third quarter results reflect two major challenges that impacted our business. First, 737 MAX fleet remaining grounded throughout quarter of course negatively impacting our pre-tax earnings by an estimated $140 million in this quarter alone. Second, we had significant operational challenges in American, in the first half of the quarter as we continue to work on negotiating an industry-leading contract we [want] [ph] for our TWU and IAM teams. As it relates to the 737 MAX that situation is of course ongoing. We have two goals for the MAX. First, of course is for Boeing to complete the FAA\u2019s required recertification process and ensure the aircraft is safely flying again. Second, is to ensure that American is compensated for the loss revenue that the MAX grounding has caused. We missed deadlines and extended grounding for our customers, our team members, and our shareholders. So we're working to ensure that Boeing shareholders bear the cost of Boeing failures not American Airlines shareholders. Turning now to our second main challenge TWU-IAM contract. We've seen significant improvements in our operational reliability as our negotiations are resumed. We've been remediated talks through the National Mediation Board since early September, those are our first talks since April. And both parties are agreed not to discuss the content of those talks publicly at the request of NMB but you should know that we're very focused on reaching an agreement, which is fair to all involved and ensures our operations back on track. Now, we recognize that beyond these two factors the status quo is not an option. We're committed to urgently improving performance and enhancing shareholder value. We want to talk about building the trust of our stakeholders and creating value for the long-term. We also appreciate in many respects, the long-term map. We know we need to do better and we will. As we knew at the end of 2019, we're committing to deliver on three key areas will create value for our shareholders in 2020, operational excellence, efficient and profitable growth, and significant free cash flow generation. I'll talk a bit about each of those. First and foremost, we must restore American\u2019s operational reliability to the standards of excellence that our customers and our team members deserve. Importantly, we believe the issues that impacted our operations for much of the summer are now behind us. We had an excellent September, and that performance has continued into October. Too months don\u2019t make a trend, we won't rely entirely on our recent performance, or our forward confidence. As Robert will discuss in more detail, we're executing on specific plans to improve our operating reliability beyond reaching a labor agreement and specific goals that we will meet. We simply will not allow our customers and team members to experience another period like this past summer again. Second, we're going to grow American's network in 2020 by approximately 5% through efficient and profitable growth. We anticipate much of this growth will be at or above system average unit revenues because it's driven by gates we've been able to acquire in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Charlotte. These are two of our highest margin hubs. And as we've already experienced in DFW this year, routes that are added into these large connecting hub operations immediately produce [yearly] [ph] revenues in excess of our system-wide average and it will be efficient growth. For example, [many of the cost] [ph] of our 737 MAX aircraft are already in our cost structure. Our operational reliability improvements will also drive some of the growth and these improvements, increase flying and reduce costs. Combining those factors with our previously announced cost initiatives give us confidence that our above average RASM growth will be added at below average incremental unit costs. Derek will provide some high level CASM estimates in his remarks and will provide more specific details on the fourth quarter call once we complete our budgeting process. But just now we're excited about our prospects to grow and to grow efficiently and profitably in 2020. Lastly and importantly, we are confident we will begin to produce significant free cash flow for our investors in 2020 and beyond. Much of that confidence is driven by the earnings improvement we expect from the first two [indiscernible] discussed, and we expect those initiatives to improve profitability over where it would be otherwise. But at the same time that's happening, we are reaching the end of an unprecedented program to invest capital into American Airlines. The $30 billion in investments we've made over the past six years have been necessary to integrate and upgrade two airlines that had suffered a lack of investment, and most importantly, to modernize an aging fleet. That work is now done and we anticipate our CapEx requirements will fall from the over $5 billion per year for the past six years to $3.7 billion in 2020, $2.1 billion in 2021, and should average approximately $3 billion thereafter. What that means for our investors, is if our estimated 2019 earnings are unchanged in both 2020 and 2021 -- in both 2020 and 2021 and this is not an earnings forecast, just an earnings constant analysis, then our free cash flow would be approximately $2.5 billion in 2020 and $3 billion in 2021. That's $5.5 billion in free cash flow in just two years at a company that has a current market capitalization of approximately $12.5 billion or a 44% free cash flow yield over just two years. And again, that's on constant 2019 earnings. None of us will be pleased with constant 2019 earnings into 2020 and 2021. So as we said in the past, as we generate that significant free cash flow, we will naturally delever our balance sheet. We will repay debt as it becomes due and the need to raise new debt against new aircraft will now be much lower. We anticipate debt requirement and adjusted debt will be significant. We expect adjusted net debt will fall by approximately $3 billion to $4 billion in the next two years and by $8 billion to $10 billion over the next five years. And we will of course, continue to return cash in excess of our needs to our shareholders, ensuring a period of significant free cash flow generation will facilitate that initiative. So in summary, we're pleased the two large issues that have impacted our performance should be addressed as we enter 2020. We are not of the view that correcting those two items alone are sufficient for our customers, our team members, or our shareholders. As it relates to our shareholders, for example, we know we have a profitability margin gap versus our largest competitor and we're committed to narrow that gap in 2020 and beyond. We're excited about our prospects for the future, and are grateful to the 130,000 hardworking team members of American Airlines, and the amazingly great work they do every day to take care of our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I will add my thanks to our team members for doing a great job of taking care of millions of customers during the busy summer travel period. Their hard work was instrumental in our ability to generate record revenue in the third quarter and grow margins despite the challenges that Doug highlighted. Importantly, we continue to execute on a number of initiatives to improve the trajectory of our business going forward. As we look at our business, the economy is strong, and our demand for our product remains robust. And we look forward to a strong holiday season. We reported another quarterly record, with third quarter revenue of $11.9 billion, 3% higher than the third quarter of 2018. This also marks the 12th consecutive quarter of unit revenue growth and we expect to produce our 13th next quarter. Derek will talk more about the revenue environment in his remarks. Global sales and distribution continue to win in the marketplace. During the quarter corporate revenue outpaced system revenue growth on healthy corporate demand, a great result given our operational challenges. As we look at our operations, we have already seen a significant improvement in our operating reliability. Since June, we have seen consistent month-over-month improvement. And for the full third quarter, our on-time metrics improved in both our mainline and regional operations. In fact, our September on-time arrival performance or A14 was the seventh best month in American\u2019s history, and our best A14 performance since November of 2017. As Doug mentioned, this improvement continues into October. We continue to strengthen our operations with ongoing enhancements, including retiring older aircraft, simplifying our fleet and schedule, and fortified our maintenance and airport resources. Our underlying execution is solid and we are committed to returning American to a position of operational excellence. And as a result, we expect our 2020 completion factor to increase by one to two percentage points and to see a significant improvements in all reliability metrics, including on-time performance, baggage handling, and customer satisfaction. We know we can't allow our customers and our team members to experience another period like this past summer ever again. So if for some unforeseen event in 2020 lead us to question our ability to meet our reliability standards, we will reduce our schedule rather than let our operations become the buffer. We don't believe that will be required of course. We also know it's a commitment we need to make to ensure that we restore operational excellence. Now with perspective the MAX, we have extended to cancel our cancellations through January 15. We continue to work closely with FAA and Boeing to have built flexibility into that date. Regardless of when the aircraft is recertified, we plan to be prudent as we reintroduce the Max back into our network. Before it begin commercial service, we will continue our collaboration with the APA and APSA accomplish training and conduct multiple flights with our pilots, flight crews, executives, and other team members to make sure that we are all comfortable that the aircraft is ready for our customers. And only then will we gradually place the aircraft back into our schedule. As part of our faced approach to reintroducing the 24 MAX aircraft that we have in storage today, we'll begin with five aircraft flying in the first two weeks, that's 22 departures per day. Two weeks later we'll add 12 more aircraft. The remaining seven will be faked into service two weeks after that and we'll add additional MAX aircraft as they become available. And note by year end 2020, we have planned to take delivery of an additional 26 MAX aircraft for a total of 50 in our fleet. While 10 of those 26 aircraft had been built we don't know exactly when they'll be delivered or when the remainder will be built. Restoration of operating reliability will drive customer satisfaction, but there is much, much more that we're doing to make the journey more efficient, easier, and more enjoyable for our customers. In fact, here are several enhancements that launched in the third quarter, which demonstrate a steady and consistent focus on improving the customer experience. First off, we put - we've added rich digital content, which has helped drive a 25% year-on-year improvement in premium economy ticket sales on aal.com. We created unique opportunities for our customers to upsell into the premium cabin, thereby significantly growing ancillary revenue and approved system that makes it easier for families to secure seats together has been added. And we've recently launched board notification to reduce the wait time at the gate for customers. And we're speeding customers\u2019 boarding through biometrics, biometrics boarding at DFW for international departures. And when there are disruptions, we've added the ability for customers to change flights and receive compensation before traveling to the airport. And we've automated hotel, meal, and transportation vouchers delivered electronically to customers during disruption. The steady stream of customer-focused deliveries provide better experience for our customers, for our team members, and certainly better results for our shareholders. We have a pipeline of additional customer friendly features that we expect to launch in 2020. The foundation of customer preference begins with our network. We continue to be extremely excited after seeing the results from our network expansion plans with growth targeted our most profitable hubs. This effort began in May, where we added 100 daily departures out of our DFW hub. With nearly two full quarters under our belt the results have exceeded our initial expectations. During the third quarter, we grew domestic capacity at DFW by 9% to produce fragile growth at the hub of 3.5%. This is the largest capacity expansion at any hub in the United States in more than a decade. It sets the stage for additional plant expansion next year in Charlotte and at Reagan National in 2021. On the partnership side late in the quarter, while Tom notified us of their intention to leave the OneWorld Alliance and a formal relationship with Delta. Well, that's disappointing, but not surprising given the regulatory challenge our proposed joint venture fate. Our vast South American network will ensure that we recaptured the majority of the potential coacher revenue on our own aircraft, and that's already proven to be the case. There has been no revenue impact since the announcement. American remains the largest U.S. carrier to Latin and South America, and we were committed to providing the best service to the region for our customers. Recently, we announced additional frequencies between Miami and Lima, Sao Paulo, and Santiago. And we're confident that with the strength of our network, we'll track other partners to -- in the region. In the Pacific, we are moving quickly to realize the opportunities provided by our new joint business agreement with Qantas. It was approved by DOJ in July. This agreement allows for commercial integration between American and Qantas delivering new routes, and ultimately significant customer benefits, including more seamless integration with traveling on the American and Qantas networks. So in conclusion, we have a great foundation built and our core business is strong. We made investments to improve the product; our fleet renewal is -- program is nearing completion. And we continue to refine our network to add margin accretive growth. We're confident that will deliver improve results in 2020 and beyond to benefit our shareholders, our customers and team members. And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Robert and good morning, everyone. During the quarter we were able to grow both pre-tax margin and earnings per share for the second successive quarter. Our third quarter results came in towards the high-end of the guidance range we provided in July. For the third quarter, our pre-tax profit excluding net special items was $835 million, resulting in a pre-tax margin excluding special items of 7% compared to 6.2% in 2018. Our third quarter 2019, pre-tax net profit excluding net special items was $630 million; a 15% increase over the third quarter of 2018. And our diluted earnings per share excluding net special items in the third quarter was $1.42 per share, up 20% from $1.19 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018. As Robert mentioned, the revenue environment remains strong with third quarter top-line growth of 3%. Passenger revenues grew by 4.1% to $11 billion a record for the third quarter. LATAM was the best performing entity during the third quarter with year-over-year unit revenue improvement of 5.9%. Brazil and Mexico led the way with double-digit improvements in yield, while we improved load factor in the entity overall by 6.5 points. Pacific unit revenue also continues to show improvement aided by our China restructuring last year with unit revenue up 1.6%. Specifically Japan and Australia were up year-over-year, while we faced challenges in Hong Kong and Korea. Atlantic unit revenue declined by 4.6%. This decline was driven by transfer payments related to our joint business agreement of about 2.3 points and currency effect of about 1 point. International point-of-sale remains challenging but we successfully shifted to North American point-of-sale and grew load factor by 3.2 points. Domestically, we saw and continue to see broad-based strength with unit revenue growth of 4% and improved unit revenue across every hub. We continue to see weakness in our cargo business, weaker demand due to trade concerns across the system drove cargo yields lower by 4% for the quarter. When combined with year-over-year international schedule reductions, the result was cargo revenues fell 19.9% to $208 million. Total operating expense in the third quarter were up 2.1% at $11.1 billion. When fuel and special items were excluded, our unit costs increased in the third quarter by 4.8% compared to 2018 due primarily to higher salaries and benefits, maintenance and regional expense, and lower than planned capacity. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $8 billion in total available liquidity well above our target liquidity balance of $7 billion. During the third quarter, we paid dividends of $44 million and repurchased $200 million of stock or 7.3 million shares. As Doug talked about, we have begun to delever the balance sheet as our CapEx requirements have reduced this year. We expect our adjusted debt position including pensions to decrease by $1.5 billion this year. On October 10, we announced we had removed the 737 MAX from our schedules through January 15, 2020. We now expect the 737 MAX grounding will have a negative full-year 2019 pre-tax income impact of approximately $540 million based primarily on loss revenue from scheduled reductions. Now that we have removed the MAX from 2019, we expect capacity growth of approximately 2.7% for the fourth quarter and 1% for the full-year. This is less than half the full-year capacity growth we had expected at the start of 2019. Despite this capacity level, our expectations for full-year cost per ASM, excluding fuel and special items is unchanged from previous guidance at approximately up 4%. For the fourth quarter, we continue to expect that our CASM, excluding fuel and special items will grow by approximately 3% despite the additional reduction in ASMs due to the MAX grounding in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we see no signs of macro softness there for bookings. We expect domestic demand to remain robust and Latin to again be the best performing international entity. We expect our fourth quarter year-over-year TRASM to be flat to up 2% and PRASM to be about a point better than TRASM. We also expect that our pre-tax margin excluding net special items to be between 5% and 7%, the mid-point of which would represent the third consecutive quarter of pre-tax margin expansion. Given our expectations for the fourth quarter, we believe that our full-year earnings per diluted share excluding net special items will be between $4.50 and $5.50. We have tightened the top-end of our previous guidance of 4.50 to $6 per share due to the additional $140 million reduction in earnings from the deferral of the MAX in 2020. Our total projected capital expenditures for 2019 is expected to be 4.3 billion comprised of 1.7 billion in non-aircraft CapEx and 2.7 billion in aircraft CapEx. The slight change from previous guidance is due to the timing of the MAX deliveries moving from 2019 to 2020. Finally, I would like to give some preliminary guidance for 2020. We're still working on the final budget and there is still a measure of uncertainty over when our MAX aircraft will be introduced to service and new aircraft delivered and available for use in our fleet. As Doug mentioned, we plan to grow our network with efficient and profitable growth. At this point, we anticipate total 2020 year-over-year capacity growth of approximately 5%. This is higher than the year-over-year 2020 growth we had anticipated in the beginning of 2019, but there's entirely due to the grounding of the MAX and the cancellations resulting from the disruption of our operations, which reduced capacity in 2019. Importantly, our year end 2020 absolute capacity is in line with our expectations from the beginning of 2019. Given this capacity guidance, we have tightened our estimate for CASM ex-fuel special items and new labor agreements to be approximately flat in 2020. With that, we'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and to begin a question-and-answer session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Joe DeNardi from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.\nJoe DeNardi: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Doug, whatever coffee you had this morning, I would like some of that. I'm wondering if you could just talk about kind of expectations for earnings next year. If you've lost $500 million or $600 million from the MAX and maybe a couple hundred million more from the mechanics issues, how much of that can you kind of recapture next year? Why shouldn't kind of the base level of earnings for the business be somewhere closer to $4 billion next year? Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Sure, Joe. Again, we won\u2019t be able to give you a much better guidance as we get through our budgeting process just begun. We can do a better job of giving you estimates next quarter, but with the two headwinds that you mentioned that we faced this year certainly should not be headwinds next year. And the amounts you described the one you showed just a little bit down is the MAX and they're not all back in January 1, as Robert described it, they phase in over the course of the year. So to the extent, whatever that headwind was in 2019 I don't think you should build all that in for 2020. But our run rate earnings are right and I'm not by any means trying to give you an earnings estimate, but absolutely agree that whatever earnings are going to be in 2019, they're going to be a good bit better. They're going to be better for the two reasons you suggest.\nJoe DeNardi: Okay. And then you've never really talked about the free cash flow outlook that bullishly. I don't think, in terms of how much it is relative to your market cap, I just want to make sure I kind of understand, I mean, from a leverage standpoint, nothing has changed, the leverage will kind of come down naturally. But we should assume that the free cash flow is primarily used to repurchase stock. Is that the idea going forward?\nDoug Parker: Yes, again let me expand a little bit then. You're right, we haven't disclosed the numbers Joe really, I mean, not because they're dramatically different than we would have said in the past versus now a year. We have -- we consistently said in the past, we're going through a period of high CapEx once we get through it, you should expect to see us generate free cash flow. When we do that, we will naturally de-lever all those statements I hopefully you would agree, we always said. What we haven't been able to do or we kind of wanted to really I\u2019m going to just tell you three years from now, here's what the numbers will be. And now and now it's upon us. And as that free cash flow gets generated in 2020, we can give you more clarity on that, so we\u2019re happy to. The $5.5 billion of free cash that I mentioned again is simple math on steady state earnings; we can all decide what earnings might be as we go forward. But that's what that is. And again, we certainly aren\u2019t going to be happy if 2019 earnings are the earnings in 20 and 21. The debt paid down numbers that I gave you are reasonably simple math. Just looking at what we what we know amortizes over the next few years and what we believe we needed to add as we do have additional requirements, but obviously, the amortizations exceed the requirements. So that's -- that number again is nothing -- it's a number we go from here giving because it's what the math is telling us. And then to your point, to the extent that first number the free cash flow generation is greater than our needs to run the airline or retire debt, we believe that cash certainly in excess of our very high cash balances is best used by returning it to our shareholders, it\u2019s their cash, us holding more than we need is a horrible use of capital. And we should return that to you as efficiently as possible. And we believe [indiscernible] by repurchasing our shares. So that's what you should expect to see from us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. Doug, I guess just looking back on the last couple of years I mean, I understand that the MAX definitely was quite disruptive this year, and you guys do have some good things going on in the network. But even giving credit for that, it does look like your Op income is still down on like a two-year basis and what's been a pretty robust economy. And not that we're necessarily comping every day to your peers, but their Op income is up in that same time period. So what retrospectively looking forward, what can change in this dynamic where American can start to really leverage the economy?\nDoug Parker: Sure, thanks, Brandon. Again well I don\u2019t have those numbers in front of me, what I do know is first off I would always argue that for airlines operating incomes is a tough measure to look at if you're trying to really look at just the operating performance and I encourage you to look at EBITDA, I know we always encourage you to capitalize our operating leases on the balance sheet. And you should do the same thing by not including the operating leases in your operating cash flows and it makes a difference. So, when you do look at EPS, so I\u2019ll suggest when I look at the numbers myself is part of what you\u2019re seeing in deterioration relative to others is what I just talked about, which is our fleet modernization, which is now done versus theirs, which is about to come. But putting it aside, I don't disagree with your point and none of us should that we've underperformed elsewhere not just in the ownership costs. And as we look to that, the primary reason is related to the issues we talked about. We have seen our properly adjusted [indiscernible] adjusted, unit revenue gap certainly versus delta which was widening as we - every year since the merger, I\u2019m sorry, which is narrowing every year since the merger, starting to widen the last six quarters. And that's not what we should be doing. We should be narrowing that gap, not widening it. Again, there are a number of reasons as to why it is but the biggest ones tend to be that we haven't executed on an operation. But I\u2019m aware there's no doubt that 737 MAX issue certainly has led to the widening of that gap. But as opposed to trying to explain what it is, what I'll tell you is we're committed now to going forward and we feel very good about that.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, I appreciate that. And I mean the relationships still kind of hold on EBITDAR basis, but that sounds good. I guess on the upside though, you guys did call out. I think Dallas in the second quarter, RASM being up a 1.5 points, I think now you\u2019re talking about in, and correct me if I'm wrong, but the hub being up about 3.5 in the third quarter. So it looks like maybe incrementally as your hubs scaling here, it's getting better performance. Is that right? And do we think that Charlotte can be the same in 2020?\nDoug Parker: Vasu Raja is here and we\u2019ll let him take that one Brandon.\nVasu Raja: Yes. And so a little bit of the effect that you see is really the effect of the peak of summer happening more in the third quarter. That said we do see a significant benefit as we improve the connectivity of our hubs. We see that not only the marginal revenues of our new flying is coming in well above the system average it\u2019s having a meaningful impact on all the flights that remain. So for example, the new flights, the new routes that we added, the new frequencies came in about 85-plus-percent marginal PRASM, we're expecting to come in at 75% but had a meaningful impact on our big trunk routes, DFW-LA, DFW-Vegas. We do anticipate an effect like that in Charlotte. And indeed we expect a meaningful effect in Charlotte because while we grow the hub and departures and improve the connectivity, we will also up-gauge the hubs. So we will have more seats on all of those, those are really [the bench] [ph] connection.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Nice to hear the renewed vigor. Are there any triggers with Boeing in the contract or potentially with lessors that would allow you to alter the delivery schedule once the MAX pipeline resumes? Also on the 5% capacity growth, what metrics do you look towards next year in determining if that's the right rate for example, would you tolerate margin contraction in 2020 after all with the pace of the buyback, you could still take out some earnings growth and free cash flow but at lower margins, would that be deemed acceptable by the team?\nDoug Parker: Let me try [indiscernible]. Irrespective what the contract, may or may not do, we want these airplanes. We want, if we refine them all today, we'd be doing. So as soon as they can be as soon as they're certified, and we have got pilots trained, we'd like to get them into service as quickly as possible. What Robert described you is what we believe is as quickly as possible. So that's, and that's the great thing to do is so we're not looking to change the delivery schedule and if anything we'd like to accelerate the delivery schedule. We feel really good about our growth prospects. Second part of the question, sorry, I think I might have answered already but go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Yes. Would you tolerate margin contraction next year after all, and not that be involved into a modeling discussion, but still get the earnings growth and free cash at lower margins. Would you accept that outcome?\nDoug Parker: We -- we're not -- anyway -- we\u2018re going to try and maximize value at all times, not so much try to manage earnings as much as maximizing value. We believe the way to maximize value is to continue to expand our network. We have fewer players today than we would like. That's a rare situation for American Airlines. But I'll tell you, every meeting we have with our planning team; they're looking on the table asking for more aircraft not fewer. We want to get those airplanes into the system. Again, this is not, this is growth you should be happy about that we work on the table for. This is in our core markets filling out something that is very rarely able, we are able to do. We just take hubs Dallas/Fort Worth and Charlotte where we have gauged and add more flights into those hubs, that\u2019s really, really good growth. And we want to do it as quickly as we can and irrespective of what that may do next year's margins earnings I don't know. What I know is that [indiscernible].\nJamie Baker: Okay. And second question, does the free cash flow commentary for 2020 include or is it predicated on Boeing competition?\nDoug Parker: It is not. I told you - again what\u2019s predicated on is, to be crystal clear, it is predicated on flat earnings year-over-year, so that\u2019s what it is.\nJamie Baker: Perfect.\nDoug Parker: And again that\u2019s not an earnings forecast. It\u2019s giving you a free cash flow number, if we had flat earnings, you should do your own earnings forecast. We'll do our best to give you a better guidance on that next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for your time. Doug, if I just take your $540 million number from the MAX that you laid out. I assume some of that -- I think some of that would probably reverse in 2020 even if the MAX doesn't come back at all, just because it's no longer a surprise that you don't have it. Is that accurate? And can you help us break out sort of the impact of having to sort of manage the schedule on a day-to-day basis the way you did versus the impact of just having less capacity overall. Does that make sense?\nDoug Parker: Yes. I think I understand the reverse side of it. What we have to remember is, I mean this is really total revenue that we lost on this is about $700 million. If you take the proposal that's the 540. So really we were lower ASMs by about 1.8%. So we just didn't fly those ASMs right. We don't get those back. So that revenue doesn't come back. Now the expenses that we had and we spent on there, those are going to be there. So you should have not see, when we put this growth back in, you shouldn't see the CASM go up as much because of the fact that the expenses were already there. So the 540 is really a number where you take about $700 million of revenue due to the not flying offset by some costs that gets you there. And you're right; the costs that are embedded in the airline today are here already to fly the aircraft when they come. So that should be, I shouldn't have to add those costs as those planes come back in. And I think that's what you're asking. Right?\nDarryl Genovesi: Actually, I was kind of asking more about the scenario where, you sort of don\u2019t -- you kind of don't get it back, right. I mean, suppose, you know, January 15th ends up being way optimistic. I'm just trying to get a sense of how much I should expect this, how much I should expect this flat CASM ex guide to move around based on the fact that I think, there are probably, for instance, I mean you're probably not going to be asking, pilots to be on schedules and getting hit by that to the extent that you did early on in this process. And so I guess I was thinking that there's probably some CASM ex relief associated with just not kind of having to manage things on a day-to-day basis like that.\nDoug Parker: Yes, you're definitely right on that. This is assuming the MAX coming back at the schedule that Robert had talked about. There could be changes to that just depending as we go forward. But this is assuming the MAX schedule that Robert talked about where they phase back into the early part of the year. And the deliveries do come in.\nRobert Isom: Hi Darryl, I'll just add that. The pilots are here, the flight attendants are here, the gates are here. So for the most part, we're ready to fly these aircraft. If we want to hear something from Boeing that was just incremental changes there's not on a heck of a lot that you can build that. To the extent that there would be something that say you don't give us much more visibility long into the future. Of course we would make adjustments. But right now it's really just around the edges that we can cut back.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. And have you slowed your hiring at all? In submission [ph] that just keeps that this continues to linger?\nDoug Parker: We slowed early in the fall here, but then we're hiring back up to meet the schedule needs for early part of the first quarter. So we're back making sure that we can fly the schedule that Robert talked about with the aircraft coming back, so that when they come back, we're ready to roll.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDoug Parker: Hey, Hunt.\nHunter Keay: Hey, Doug good morning. I actually have a question for Derek and a question for Vasu. Derek, can you just help me understand the accounting of how you guys will realize the concession payments from Boeing don't care how much it's going to be just want to know if it's going to impact the P&L is my main question?\nDerek Kerr: We do not have an answer on that yet. It all depends on how we get it back. The accounting is if you get it against the aircraft price that would just go into reduced aircraft price and wouldn't hit the P&L. If it comes back as lost earnings, it possibly could hit the P&L. So we don't -- we do not know yet. We're in negotiations with Boeing and have continued to talk with them. And as we continue to go through that, we will update everybody on where it will hit P&L and if it will hit the P&L and what that number is going to be.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Great. And then Vasu, the 5% capacity growth. I'm surprised that\u2018s so low, it implies only about 3.5% core growth in 2020. Can you help me? Can you peel that back for me a little bit? I mean, how is this so low and maybe you can talk about a mix of domestic and international gauge anything like that I was expecting you guys to show more like 4% or 5% sort of core growth. So is that a conservative number, any color on that would be great from your perspective. Thank you.\nVasu Raja: Yes, hey Hunter first of all, we're still working through our high level of operations for next year. But I'd say the simple way to think of it is that about a quarter-and-a-half or so is just the bring back of the MAX. The remainder of it is the growth of our core business. And of that remainder, it's pretty evenly split between just a variety of gauge initiatives and an actual departure-based growth. As far as the domestic and international split we're still kind of working through that right now. Of course, we've announced a lot of international receiving probably backs off for some of it. But we anticipate that domestic will moderately outgrow International, but it'll be pretty close. But we're refining it more in the next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thank you. Derek, sorry, if I didn't hear it correctly. But does your flat CASM outlook or preliminary flat CASM outlook include or exclude new labor agreements?\nDerek Kerr: It excludes labor agreements.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And how would you handicap probabilities. And I know you don't want to talk about terms but timing on mechanics and pilots next year?\nDoug Parker: Hey Duane, I will talk on that one. Again I said in my comments I\u2019ve agreed NMB\u2019s request not to discuss, we\u2019re under negotiations and that starts to do it. I know it's important to you. We hopefully understand, we're much more focused on getting the negotiation done. I don't want to jeopardize that. So if you don't mind, what is telling you that we're happy to run negotiations, we're happy that the NMB has asked us in post live not to talk about it. We think that helps the negotiations rather than hurt them and we don't want to violate that when we do have a contract. We will absolutely let you know the answers to those questions.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Totally fair, sorry for asking.\nDoug Parker: Okay, not a problem.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the surprise that was kind of dumped on you by the Chilean courts, which catalyzed this change with LATAM. But can you talk about how you're going to replace that feed? For example, would you envision a JV across multiple airlines in South America?\nRobert Isom: I'll go ahead and then start on that. The great news is that our network by far the best in the South America, there's a lot that we can do to augment that on our own. And while again, LATAM was disappointing you also have to realize the nature of what that was and what it could be. So for now, customers are choosing to purchase American and fly American. And as we take a look at what goes for of course that network we have in South America could be really attractive to a lot of partners. And so we're busy working and exploring and evaluating the opportunities that are out there right now so, good things to come.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Just a question on the International growth here in the Trans-Atlantic. I recognize you had some individual items and FX that was kind of hurting it, what\u2019s driving the kind of the double-digit increase and would you expect that to moderate, given the unit revenue pressures?\nVasu Raja: Yes, hi this is Vasu. Look a lot of what's really driving our capacity growth that growth was just simply the growth of capacity. As Derek mentioned in his opening remarks in the last year, we did a lot to go and restructure international network, we cut something in the order of 17 or 18 routes across the system that were really long-term money losers, and we turned them into 22 new routes, much of which was growth in Trans-Atlantic and all of which is coming at a really attractive revenue clip. They are having some issues in 3Q with foreign exchange and things like that, as Derek mentioned, but the marginal profitability of the routes we've added in Trans-Atlantic has been pretty impressive. And indeed, year-to-date, our Trans-Atlantic unit revenues on an absolute basis have been higher than they've been in any point since the merger. So we're encouraged by it. It's been really great utilization for our airplanes, and all together margin positive for us.\nSavi Syth: Thank you. And then if might ask on the network side question, just curious on your view on Chicago, it's -- you've made some changes there. And one of your competitors is definitely kind of refocused in that hub and now is -- is they kind of introduce the 550 some of those the leadership that you had with some of the kind of the taking advantage of your larger great regional aircraft opportunity there. That advantage seems to be eroding as we look forward in the network. Any thoughts on how you view kind of the performance in Chicago and your positioning in Chicago?\nRobert Isom: Yes, we're actually really excited for our future in Chicago on a number of levels that I mean for one, and I've talked about this probably in lot of forum, removing Chicago to Asia, for us has been actually a big benefit to the Chicago hub. A lot of that was not just unprofitable flying in and of itself, it was claiming space off of domestic airplanes and things like that that could have otherwise gone to other customers in the Chicago local market or people connecting from other parts of business. So that alone has been a big change in Chicago. And also as we look forward though, our principal competitor there is indeed rolling out the new product, the reality is, we still will be able to offer more First Class seats to the Chicago customer. We absolutely intend to continue doing that. One of the major things that we're excited for, as we go into next year and work through the MAX situation is it will have a lot more flexibility to do things like bringing the A319 into Chicago, which will enable us to kind of upguage regional jet markets to vary our capacity more through day of week, create a lot of variability in the schedule that ultimately goes into tracks the key business customers in the Chicago and Greater Midwest area that our principal competitor seems to be targeting. So we very much like our chances out there, we very much will continue to do that. And even going forward looking longer run as we ourselves continue to aggressively replace single class 50 seat RJs with 2-class airplanes, Chicago will be a place where we'll continue to thrive and be able to produce some improving results.\nDon Casey: This is Don. I will just add one more data timeframe and we really have performed the domestic business in the third quarter we have 12% and our best performing hub for unit revenue was Chicago.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRajeev Lalwani: Hi, good morning gentlemen. Thanks for the time. Doug, a question for you, I appreciate the enthusiasm this morning but what makes this time different versus before? I mean, we've heard relatively bullish pitches from you and I'll stay down in Dallas a couple of years ago, so what stands out this time versus then the story get the buy-in from investors and analysts alike?\nDoug Parker: One, you haven\u2019t heard from us before these cash flow initiatives, other cash volumes, sorry generation because we couldn't say it before. Again, that's not anything I feel pretty badly about. We needed to invest in this company. And we were describing the time to our investors and it was going to be significant. And the reality is, while we were making record profits, we weren't generating cash flow because we were spending it on upgrading our fleet of that $31 billion I talked about in the last six years, $23 billion of that was spent on new airplanes. So that's behind us, so that's a new message, hope it gets a change in bullishness, it's a new message and one that I think is important to our investors. So that's point one. And the other only what I'd add to the bullishness piece is our bullishness at the moment is not driven by us seeing anything differently than anyone else, it's driven by our absolute understanding that we -- our earnings this year were hindered by two circumstances that we fully expect to be behind us early in 2020 and our commitment to ensure that we have operational excellence and the growth prospects all of that as we try in Chicago, in conclusions that\u2019s what we are.\nRajeev Lalwani: All right, that\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, just maybe for Derek as well broadly on labor, I don't want to talk about specific contracts but broadly on labor, do you believe that you've got a step-up in wages to get the buy-in of employees? I mean, that was sort of a strategy united it seems to be successful for now. But maybe I'm not thinking about it or approaching it the right way that that may be needed to deliver on some of what you're describing?\nDerek Kerr: Yes, look as we talk to our employees, the biggest thing we need to do for our team is provide our live operation. We and thanks to some frontline leadership have done a really nice job of taking care of our team we have, as you're well aware needed to increase compensation across the board to get our wage levels to where their peers in other airlines are because they certainly deserve to be paid relative as much or more as those that are doing similar jobs at airlines. But this the issue we're dealing with now as it relates to the team is, we need to give them the tools they need to do their jobs, which they do so incredibly well. That's go and take care of customers. And we haven't been doing that. We don't run, we don't have operational excellence; our team ends up bearing the brunt of that. They end up not being where they're supposed to be, they end up having inventory over time, they end up having unhappy customers, all of which impact the runoff. So what we're -- what we know and further is operational excellence is to our customers and to our shareholders. It's really important to our team, and that's all those reasons why we're so committed to making sure it happens, and we believe doing that will do more for our team than anything else we can do right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Yes, hey Doug. Hey, two quick questions here, I guess on fleet, Doug, the $8 billion to $10 billion reduction in net debt over the next five years. Presumably, there's no major fleet decision for American probably out till 2024, 2025. That's kind of implicit in that. And if that is the case, what is the next aircraft type in the fleet that you're looking at that, you then have to address? What's the timing on that? Thank you.\nDoug Parker: I would add, I\u2019ll let Derek to add. Yes, that\u2019s Mike. [Indiscernible] we will have the MDAs were gone out, the A190 were gone out of the fleet, the 760 were gone out of the fleet, 75s will eventually go out of the fleet. So the next real big decision for us is in the A319 category. Everything else will those aircraft are and on average 15 years today. So as you said, we don't have any decision to make until, 2025 timeframe, we might talk earlier, but I think it's really in that category, the 319 category and what will be the replacement for that and our 320 at the bottom and 150 seat range to 130 seat range.\nDerek Kerr: And Mike I\u2019ve got the data points for you and everyone else. As we look at our fleet now, only 10% of our fleet, only 10% of our fleet was 20 years or older as compared, contrasted to our two large competitors have about a third of their fleets 20 years or older. So anyway, it'll be a while, we feel very good. And indeed, over half of our fleet is zero to 10 years. So we again, it took us a while to get there, we had to spend a lot to do it. But we feel really good about where we are with our fleet and certainly relative to our cash needs versus our competitors going forward.\nMike Linenberg: Agreed, great position to be in. And then just my second follow-up on, on the A321 NEO, I mean, you're obviously taking delivery of them now and into 2020. Given that you are I think Airbus you may be their largest customer for the A320 family right now just looking at your fleet and the potential, any chance that you can have those airplanes deliver out of Mobile rather than Europe as we move forward?\nDerek Kerr: Yes. I would say, this is Derek and we have already a schedule out through the mid of 2020, where we'll have nine coming out of Mobile, six of them are Hamburg today. And then we have still six to be determined. So we'll do everything we can, we have 21 deliveries for the next two years, we're doing everything we can to talk to Airbus, to try to get them out of Mobile and make sure that those aircraft come from that manufacturing facility instead of Hamburg. But as of today of the 21, we have come in six come from Hamburg, nine from Mobile and six yet to be determined, which are late in 2020 that we will continue to work to get to those out of Mobile.\nDoug Parker: Hi Mike, impliciting your question, I think is that if we didn't do that that we would be paying the tariffs, as what you have been saying that, let me assume we did.\nMike Linenberg: Yes, definitely.\nDoug Parker: Look what we know don't think no that the USTR place the tariffs with the level it did to ensure that the burden didn't get borne by U.S. airlines but by the French. So we're happy to work with airbus to mitigate that amount. But I don't think you should assume that if it's not mitigated that American Airlines would be -- would be a worse borne. Having said that, what we really hope is that it never get to that point, the answer this is not to keep escalating and having tariffs on both sides. The answer to this is for the European Commission, USTR sit down and work this out in a way that doesn't have tariffs going places. But if they can't do that, this again, we're certain that the goal of the USTR was not to have these tariffs paid by U.S. airlines, and then passed on to U.S.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi, everybody. And thank you for the time. I just had two questions. My first question is with respect to how you're intending to use Envoy on some of your other regional airlines for the capacity growth that you're doing in Dallas, in Charlotte. And then my other follow-up question is, as you think about growing Latin America, which you\u2019ve talked about in your prepared remarks relative to taking up that capacity that you're kind of losing with LATAM, is there space at Miami that do the same thing you're doing in Charlotte, DCA and in Dallas? Thank you.\nVasu Raja: Hey, Helane, this is Vasu. Let me take your questions in reverse order. First of all, space in Miami. Yes, we have the space in Miami to grow in any number of ways adding the three flights that Robert mentioned earlier and is all accommodated within the capacity footprint that we have there. We have a really great position in Miami, a really great relationship with Miami airport and community at large. And so the way we see this is Robert says that we will always have the biggest and the best Latin American network, it is at the very heart of our competitive advantage as an airline. And that's one thing that that even through all of this stuff we will continue to do and will continue to be able to go and operate in Miami and grow there, though it doesn't have the profitability of markets like DFW and Charlotte, there are routes out of Miami that are among -- are most critical for our customers and certainly and in certain days a week in times of year, it was really attractive marketplace for us and you'll see us take full advantage of that in the year ahead. To your first question about Envoy growth, which I think in part you meant Envoy maybe you meant kind of regional versus mainline. I'll speak to both, our growth this past year has been heavily driven by the regional operations. Next year it will be more heavily driven by our mainline operation. Our growth in Charlotte especially is less about growing our regional jets. It's about one improving the connectivity of the hub making more O&D market and very critically having more seats on all those O&Ds. So you'll see a few things like bring the 737s in the larger degree, turn more regional jets in the mainline, we endeavor to do the same thing in DFW as well. Now that said our regional jet network is a very critical part of our airline that does, as we say the little jets make the big jets go. And so we -- there will be a big dose of regional jet growth as well. It'll just lag the mainline next year, whereas this year it kind of outpaced the mainline.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan McKenzie for Buckingham Research. Your line is open.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, good morning, thanks for the time here. If possible, I would love to clarify the messaging on 2020, so CASM ex-fuel flat next year, you expect to grow earnings investors are going to interpret that as your base outlook for either revenues to be flat or up despite a pretty high capacity picture. So not asking for 2020 revenue guidance, of course, but just trying to make sure there is just no flaw here in the preliminary? Thank you.\nDoug Parker: But you are asking for revenue guidance. If we take out the CASM is flat [indiscernible] earnings are up, sounds like that revenue guidance. But look I wanted to go back to what we said so far Dan and we are not yet prepared to give you real guidance on earnings in 2020 because we are doing our own work and so we will let you know more as we know more ourselves. Certainly in the next call, we want to give you better guidance on 2020. Earnings forecast but and you should do your own work on what you think about and thinking on revenue and where we are relative to that, right now we can\u2019t give you much more than this.\nDan McKenzie: Yes, understood. Okay, had to try of course. Okay, so good commentary, free cash flow demand, solid revenue backdrop, there is worry that the parallel universe that the consumer today goes the way of the industrial sector tomorrow, I've had more than one conversation with owners about what Americans earnings would look like in the downturn. And again, I know that's not your message today, but can you talk about the fleet flexibility, so both narrow-body, wide-body and is there a way to get ahead of the economic data points as they start to worsen?\nDerek Kerr: Yes, Dan we have a significant amount of fleet flexibility. We have unencumbered aircraft, some 264 aircraft, almost 100 of those mainline, 172 Regional, we have 65 deliveries to come next year which we could, we could deal with if we needed to lease extensions, there's about 47 of those that would come off and then older aircraft, we have 53 of those, which most of those are in the unencumbered category. So and we have upwards 300 350 aircraft, fleet flexibility that if something happened, we could take the fleet down, if required if there was some type of a recession or anything like that, but as I said earlier, we're not seeing anything like that in our bookings, and things just continue to stay strong.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our last analyst question from David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the time. Question for you on the focus for 2020. Obviously, Rob and Doug you talked about getting the anti-performance and the basic execution done and improved. I'm just wondering if there are specific things in the revenue pipeline that will help you to narrow that gap that you mentioned before on the unit revenue side with some of your peers.\nDon Casey: Yes, this is Don. Again, if you go and look at our past year\u2019s unit revenue performance this year in 2019, we did better than our [indiscernible] by 1 point based on guidance for 4Q that was based on the readiness in the pipeline this year, which also included our growing operation in Dallas, which we had in place, 1st of July. So as we look forward into 2020, we continue to have a pipeline of revenue initiatives. Obviously next year, big part of that is going to be the annualization of growth in Dallas, adding the growth in Charlotte, and we are going to be updating and adding seats to airplanes, which is going to be great thing to our revenue performance in 2020.\nDavid Vernon: Anything on the product set specifically that you can talk to around whether it's some of the premium products or some of the other work you've been doing on the cabin side that would help us kind of look for scale to get some update?\nDoug Parker: Don you can chime in here, but hey one is that we're finally getting to the point of being able to offer instant upsell in higher level cabin. So as we've been improving our affiliate segment, whether it's through main Cabin Extra or premium economy type seats, being able to offer that to customers in a convenient way, is something that we finally have the technology to be able to do and that was launched earlier this summer, expanded throughout the domestic and now we're looking to move that that to international and also into other channels as well. So that's something that will absolutely help us take advantage of the product offerings that we have out there. And to Don\u2019s point, in terms of being able to harmonize our cabins and ensure that we have the configurations we want. We had to take a hiatus because of operational issues this past summer on those programs, those have been restarted and we anticipate that our 737 classic fleet will be fully upgraded by the summer of 2021.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the deleveraging that's going to happen over the next couple of years. Is there anything you can tell us about the rates on this that you'll be retiring versus the rates you're paying on more recent debt like is there going to be any sort of shift in the effect of interest rate as you are modeling out the next couple years for cash flow?\nDerek Kerr: I would say -- this is Derek. I would say no, I think our average debt is around 4% right now. So most of the higher price that we've paid off, it might be slightly higher of the old things we are going to pay off because most of it is aircraft that will include pension too. So we're going to take the pension down by about $3 billion in that calculation. So from an aircraft standpoint, it will be older aircraft that that is probably up in the 5% range, little bit higher than what our average cost of debt but not significantly higher.\nDoug Parker: Just for clarification, $3 billion in the $8 billion to $10 billion.\nDerek Kerr: Yes, $3 billion is in the $8 billion to $10 billion sorry of the -- over the five-year period.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will now open up the lines for media to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And our first question we will take is Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.\nAlison Sider: Hi, thank you so much, hi. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about sort of the tone of the discussions you're having with Boeing around compensation. Is there progress being made or from your comments this morning, is there concern about an impact there?\nDoug Parker: Alison I will start. Again the discussions are underway, but I guess I characterize it as early. I think not just -- no reason for us to be concerned at this point, but also no real clarity at this point. Much of the reason being, from the standpoint of Boeing still not certainty as to when the aircraft will be recertified. So talks are underway but they're early, but we feel highly confident that the losses that American Airlines have incurred, won't be incurred by American shareholders but will be borne by the Boeing shareholders.\nAlison Sider: Got it. And are you concerned at all about any additional delays in return to service timing and I guess, broadly do you feel like Boeing, the leadership changes this may lately have gone far enough or do you think the company might have to do more?\nDoug Parker: We were asked to return to service. The answer to that question asked to return to service. Our -- the date that we have January 15 is based on the best information we have from talking to not just Boeing but the FAA. We were encouraged to see Boeing announce I think earlier this week that they believe the aircraft will be certified in the fourth quarter. So, that information, I guess is probably -- it's probably safe it is probably best described that information in best case given what we've all seen over the course of this process, but it's a reasonable case. And therefore, we, if indeed, that is -- that situation is correct, if indeed the aircraft is recertified in the fourth quarter, we absolutely, we will be able to have our five airplanes as I described, certified flying revenue as early as January 15. If indeed that doesn't tend to be the case, we will once again, need to adjust. And we've unfortunately are getting really good at that, we have designed this one in particular, to be easier to do than others in that regard. So, yes, we're frustrated. But it is hopefully getting to the point. It certainly feels as though the delay that we hear about seem to be shorter delays. The confidence seems to be higher. But we don't take that as certainly close to it. But based on everything we know today, certainly seems reasonable to have these aircraft and our schedule to five airplanes January 15 and we are highly to be the case. If indeed that has not been the case, we will adjust and let our customers know well in advance.\nAlison Sider: Got it, thanks and on leadership.\nDoug Parker: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson from USA Today. Your line is open.\nDoug Parker: Hi Dawn.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi, good morning. Hey, two questions. One Robert you mentioned under your consumer initiative, new technology, I think you said related to helping families sit together. Can you go into any detail on that? And my second question is seat fees are really prevalent right now. And I'm wondering where that you can give any sense of the revenue opportunities there and where that ranks right now in terms of ancillary revenue? Thanks.\nRobert Isom: Hey Dawn, I didn't hear the second part of the question. The first part is just in terms of sitting families together, I\u2019ll just say this, we've always had a technology to help, we've improved our algorithms. And ultimately, we're getting a much better hit rate of making sure that we protect and we reserve seats for those families. And so there's good things, there's good things on that front, but all technology-based and really enhancements to processes that we have in place today. But now as it works, the second part of your question was I didn't appear there was seat fees, did you said that?\nDawn Gilbertson: I wanted to get a sense of the scope of you started these preferred seat fees and every all airlines have them now pretty much to one degree or another. And it seems to me that's got to be a pretty big revenue. You're bringing a lot of money from these preferred seat fees. And I'm just wondering if you can give us any sense of the scope of that, where you plan to take that and where that ranks now in kind of in the ancillary hierarchy?\nDon Casey: Yes. This is Don Casey. We've done quite a bit on the seat service. One is just introducing different products; the main Cabin Extra we\u2019re going to relaunch with enhanced benefits a year ago, that has proven to be very successful. And again there are customers do have the willingness to pay right a bit more for their product. And that's what we're finding out in the marketplace. So we're continuing to expand the product portfolio for better products out there and provide better capabilities for customers to buy out into those better products. And we're seeing good demand. Seat fee revenue today is now our second largest ancillary revenue stream after bags.\nDawn Gilbertson: If I could just ask just a quick follow-up related to that, when you say on seat fee revenue, does that include so that includes your preferred seat fees, where you get nothing extra and also main Cabin Extra? What's in that basket?\nDon Casey: It\u2019s basically every additional charge that customer is willing to pay for a better seat on the airplane. So in the case of preferred seats, those are aisles and windows and close to the front. And they have an extra, extra leg room, free drink and better dedicated access to games and [indiscernible].\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tracy Rucinski from Reuters. Your line is open.\nDoug Parker: Hi, Tracy.\nTracy Rucinski: Hi, good morning. Doug, I was wondering what is your own position on the Boeing employees\u2019 instant messages about MCAST and the simulator and the emails that referred to not including mention of MCAST in the flight manual?\nDoug Parker: We don\u2019t have a position on that. Our position is we're highly interested in having the airplane. Boeing meet the requirements of the FAA and get the airplane recertified. I will note that we think the FAA is doing a fantastic job with this process and it\u2019s showing real leadership. They always do on safety in aviation, and we feel really confident that once the FAA recertifies this airplane it\u2019s one of the safest in the world. And we're looking forward to that date.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Edward Russell from The Points Guy. Your line is open.\nEdward Russell: All right, thank you. Vasu I need to ask about your comments on Chicago, you mentioned offering more first class seats than competitors and then you talked about shifting to more A319s in 2020. However, my understanding it\u2019s been, it\u2019s eight first class seats versus some of your 12 seat aircraft at 12 instead of offering 10 on their new door aircraft, door class aircraft, talk a bit more about what's the strategy is to attract business travelers in the Chicago market?\nVasu Raja: Yes, Ed, great question. And importantly, the 319 eight first class seats anytime we're taking out a single class 50 seater, and replacing with bigger jet. Of course going from zero first class seats to something more than that, regardless of what it is. So with that in mind, really, there's multiple things that we plan to do in Chicago. One of which is look, we have a luxury in Chicago that our competitor doesn't have, which is that we have a gigantic East West Hub in DFW for our competitor that is the best East West Hub that they have. And so what we're really interested in doing is being able to provide the best product and schedule to the customers of Chicago to the world. And we will increasingly do this as we move through a number of our fleet initiatives and product initiatives too. We will have better schedule on the key days the business travelers go; we will vary the capacity levels that we have in the course of the week. And then over the long-term, what will increasingly do is as we do more 50 seat replacements, you'll see more and more two-class services, whether it's larger, RJ319, or 737s coming into Chicago.\nDon Casey: I will just ask Don that customers right now, I mean they like our product in Chicago and we\u2019re seeing it in the numbers. I mentioned earlier in Chicago is the highest in any hub we have and we grew our corporate passenger volumes in Chicago in the third quarter by 7%. So customers like the product we have there right now.\nEdward Russell: Okay, thank you. So just to be clear, I'm understanding the 50 seaters will come out 319 this year and seat markets will step up to 76 seaters and those [indiscernible] that's kind of the idea of sort of the cascade going on for Boeing?\nRobert Isom: Yes, Ed. Over time they will, we're working through what that looks like. I think at this point, we're probably not yet ready to reveal all of it. But that is our long-term plan, as long been our fleet plan and marketplace Chicago, is kinds of things we have in mind for it.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I now would like to turn the call back over to Doug Parker for any closing remarks.\nDoug Parker: All right. Thank you all very much for your interest and we appreciate it and if you have any questions, either contact Investor Relations or Corporate Communications, we will be happy to answer. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "AAL", "quarter": 2, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-07-25 15:13:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the American Airlines Group Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. You may begin.\nDan Cravens: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining us in the room this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for our Q&A session are several of our senior execs, including Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs, and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management. In addition, we have Devon May, our Senior VP of Networks Strategy; and Kenji Hashimoto, our Senior VP of Finance. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results; Derek will then walk us through the details on the second quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then, after we hear from those comments, we will open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast or capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans, and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and that can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us this morning. And at this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thank you, Dan, and thanks everyone who are with us this morning. Today, we are happy to report improved second quarter results for American Airlines. The company produced pre-tax income excluding special items of $1.1 billion for the quarter and a year-over-year increase in our diluted earnings per share of 10%. It's a revenue driven improvement. We saw record second quarter revenue of $12 billion as well as record second quarter total revenue per available seat mile. The credit for producing these results goes entirely to our team, our 130,000 colleagues are doing a great job of taking care of our customers during the peak season and they're doing it despite a challenging summer. In fact the people in American are doing heroic, thanks for taking care of our customers and it shows in these results, and our projections for 2019 earnings, which have improved since our last quarter call. But as excited as we are about the team's performance this quarter, we're even more excited about the potential at American Airlines and our potential for value creation in 2020 and beyond. The challenges we face this summer are near-term issues that absolutely will be addressed with time. And as we look to the long-term though the results we've produced despite these obstacles give us the utmost confidence in what lies ahead. And that's particularly true as we move into a period when our investments taper off significantly and the results of those investments continue to increase. So with that I'll turn over to Derek and then Robert to give you more details and then we'll get the questions. Derek?\nDerek Kerr: Thanks, Doug, and good morning everybody. The ongoing grounding of our MAX fleet as well as operational issues caused by the weather and the union action meant that it was undoubtedly a challenging quarter for American Airlines. However thanks to the efforts of our team members we were able to produce financial results that exceeded our expectations at the start of the quarter. So I'd like to thank everyone for their hard work over the past few months. In the second quarter, 2019 earnings press release in Form 10-Q that we filed this morning, we reported a second quarter net profit excluding net special items of $810 million, a 5.1% increase over the second quarter of 2018. Our diluted earnings per share excluding that special items in the second quarter was $1.82 per share, up 10% from a $1.66 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. Our second quarter 2019 pre-tax profit excluding net special items was $1.1 billion resulting in a pre-tax margin of 9% compared to 8.7% in 2018. This was the first quarter, our year-over-year margin expansion since the first quarter of 2016. Despite the operational challenges during the quarter, our total revenues were a record for the second quarter at $12 billion, up 2.7% versus second quarter 2018. Our total revenue per ASM increased for the 13th consecutive quarter by 3.5% to $16.54 also a record for the second quarter. We saw increased strength in demand for travel during the quarter resulted in passenger revenues increasing by 3.2% to $11 billion. Robert will give you more color on the trends we are seeing in the revenue improvements during his remarks. Our cargo yields were slightly higher during the quarter, but year-over-year scheduled reductions and falling demand in Asia and Europe markets meant that cargo revenue fell 15.4% to $221 million despite that increase in yields. Our loyalty program continues to grow steadily which drove other revenues up by 2.9% to $728 million. This growth was primarily due to new card acquisitions as access to the world's largest program and best network continues to be a strong incentive for new customers. Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2019 were 1.6% higher at $10.8 billion when fuel and special items are excluded, our unit costs increased in the second quarter by 4.8% higher than previous guidance due primarily to lower than planned second quarter ASMs which declined 0.8% from 2018 as a result of the operational disruptions I mentioned earlier. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $8.2 billion in total available liquidity. So far this year, our treasury team has completed a number of transactions including securing financing for 26 new mainline and regional aircraft to be delivered in 2019 and 2020 through mortgage and sale leaseback structures. With the exception of three regional aircraft delivered in the fourth quarter, we have committed financing for all aircraft deliveries through 2019. Additionally, we have committed financing for 25 of over 2020 deliveries and we'll continue to evaluate financing options for our remaining mainline and regional aircraft deliveries. In May 2019, we raised $750 million in an unsecured notes offering and used the proceeds to fund contributions to our defined benefit plans. In aggregate, we made contributions of $858 million to our defined benefits plan in the second quarter for total contributions of $1.2 billion year-to-date or $436 million in excess of our required contributions. As a result, we have prefunded a portion of our 2020 requirements and our remaining minimum funding obligation for next year is now forecasted to be approximately $200 million. Lastly, in June 2019, we completed a spare engine WTC transaction in the U.S. private placement market to raise $650 million at attractive rates which are comparable to those achieved in aircraft WTCs. During the second quarter, we paid dividends of $44 million. We did not repurchase any stock as fuel prices remained high for much of the quarter which pushed our projected year-end liquidity near our target level of $7 billion and prices didn't fall until we had entered the closed trading window. We remain committed to returning cash above our liquidity target to our shareholders. We continue to expect that our 2019 year-end net debt including pensions and the present value of aircraft rents will be more than $1 billion lower compared to year-end 2018. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future as our CapEx obligations normalized from the peak years of our fleet transformation program which will also result in significant free cash flow generation by the airline. While we expect 2019 to be relatively flat in terms of free cash flow generation due to the increased pension contribution, we are currently forecasting to generate significant free cash flow in 2020 and 2021. On July 14, we announced that we had removed the Boeing MAX from our schedules until November 2nd. Previously we were guided to a full-year negative impact to pre-tax income of approximately $350 million which was based primarily on lost revenues from scheduled reductions forced by the removal of the MAX from our operating fleet. We have now reviewed all of the data from the second quarter and given the extension of the grounding period, we now anticipate that the impact to the full-year will be approximately $400 million. We now estimate that the impact on the second quarter was approximately $175 million and estimate that the impact on the third quarter will be approximately $125 million, lower than the impact of the second quarter as we are no longer seeing the short-term disruption to passenger travel that the grounding caused in April. We remain confident in the aircraft and look forward to reintegrating the aircraft into our fleet once all of the regulatory approvals are in place. During the June, we announced an order of 50 aircraft, Airbus A321 XLR aircraft with delivery scheduled to begin in 2023 and end in 2025. 30 of these orders were a conversion of the existing A321neo orders with the other 20 being an exercise of existing Neo options. Since the aircraft order was already part of our long-term fleet plan, it does not materially change our expectations for capital expenditures in these years. The expected range and capabilities of XLR are impressive and will add flexibility to our fleet opening up the potential for exciting new markets for our customers that we will be able to fly very efficiently. In addition in our fleet plan filed this morning as part of our usual investor update, we announced that we have extended the operating life of some of our A320, 737, and 757 aircraft on a short-term basis. These extensions will allow us more flexibility as we deal with the grounding of the MAX and the late delivery of the A321neo's and provide modest and efficient growth to our fleet. With the extension of MAX cancellations to November 2nd, we now anticipate capacity growth of approximately 1.5% for both the third quarter and the full-year. This is approximately half the full-year capacity we had expected at the start of the year which has put upward pressures on our unit cost expectations. For the full-year, we now expect that our 2019 cost per ASM excluding fuel special items and new labor agreements will grow by approximately 4%. This increased from previous guidance of an increase of between 2% and 3% is driven entirely by the reduction in the anticipated ASM growth primarily driven by the MAX. As a result, we now expect our CASM excluding fuel special items and new labor agreements will increase by approximately 5% in the third quarter and 3% in the fourth quarter. Based on the forward curve, as of July 22nd, we are forecasting that our average fuel price will be between $2.05 and $2.10 per gallon in the third quarter for the full-year will be $2.04 to $2.09. For revenue, we expect our total revenue per ASM will grow between 1% and 3% in the third quarter. And given the cost guidance I outlined above, we expect that third quarter pre-tax margin excluding net special items will be between 5.5% to 7.5%. We now believe that our earnings per diluted share excluding net special items will be between $4.50 to $6 in 2019 and continue to expect that we will see margin expansion in the second half of 2019. Our total projected capital expenditures for 2019 remain unchanged at $4.4 billion comprised of $1.7 billion in non-aircraft CapEx and $2.7 billion in aircraft CapEx. We now expect total CapEx of $3.6 billion in 2020 and $2.1 billion in 2021. The guidance for 2020 and 2021 is slightly lower than the previous guidance as a result of the XLR agreement I referred to earlier in my remarks. In conclusion, 2019 has certainly presented some unexpected challenges which have stressed our operation and put our team in some very difficult situations. But our front line team has met every challenge and done a phenomenal job of helping out our customers and supporting each other. We look forward to moving past these short-term headwinds and executing on all of the exciting projects that we have in the pipeline. And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Derek. Good morning everyone. Before I begin I too would like to thank our team members for doing a great job of taking care of our customers given the issues that we've faced with our fleet in operation. Their hard work and perseverance were instrumental in our ability to generate record second quarter revenues. While we faced some significant challenges during the second quarter, we also had some notable achievements including the completion of our rollout of our industry-leading premium economy product, the expansion of our DFW hub, and the completion of our high speed Wi-Fi installation. I'll spend some time discussing the challenges but I want to spend the majority of my time emphasizing all of the great things our team is doing and the positive momentum that we're seeing within our business. As for challenges, as Derek mentioned in his remarks on July 14, we made the decision to extend the cancellations of our Boeing 737 MAX aircraft through November 2nd, while the return date has shifted from our original expectations, we remain optimistic that the aircraft will return to service in November. Our confidence in Boeing, FAA, and other regulatory agencies remains intact and we are committed partners along with our Allied Pilots Association and Association of Professional Flight Attendants in this ongoing process. As always, as new information becomes available we'll assess the impact on our schedule and initiate changes as soon as possible to take best care of our customers and team. In terms of our operation, in May, we initiated the litigation against the union representing our mechanic team members for engaging in a coordinated legal work slowdown in an effort to influence contract negotiations. That slowdown has significantly impacted the company's operations and caused a high number of flight cancellations and delays in the second quarter. A temporary restraining order enjoining the slowdown and further interruption to the company's operation was granted by the court. The court is in the process of ruling on a permanent injunction against the continuation of these illegal activities and we are waiving that decision. Ultimately, our goal is to get back to the negotiating table where we will work to get our mechanics and fleet service team members, the industry-leading contract that they deserve just as we have with all of our other team members. Throughout the legal work action and really for any disruptions now and in the future, our team is doing their best to take care of our customers and their co-workers. Fortunately we have new tools to help in that effort. Improved customer notifications for delays and cancellations, automated hotel meal and transportation arrangements, enhanced self-service rebooking, and snacks and amenities at the gates during longer delays are just some of the measures that are being utilized to ensure that our customers' needs are being addressed. We certainly apologize to any customers that have been inconvenienced and we want you to know that our customer relations team is working nonstop to address shortfalls in our service. As we have discussed on several of our past earnings calls, we've been focused on improving our operating reliability. And we feel very confident that we're making significant operational improvements based on the performance of our regional operation which has not been affected by the labor issues at the mainline operation. For example, at our hubs, our regional performance saw a 1.5 point year-over-year improvement in on time departures, a 3.2 point in year-over-year improvement in aircraft turn performance, and 1.2 point year-over-year improvement in controllable completion factor. Thanks to the outstanding efforts of our regional team. This improved performance provides a nice control set and gives us confidence that the initiatives that we've put in place will be successful across the system once we move past these short-term challenges. Now for positive momentum. We continue to take big steps forward in creating a world-class customer experience that further differentiates American from our competitors. During the second quarter, we opened our new Flagship First Dining, Flagship Lounge, and renovated Admirals Club Lounge in Terminal D at our largest airport DFW. These enhancements are just the latest in more than $200 million investment in our premium products and services and complements our other flagship lounges at JFK, Los Angeles, Miami, and Chicago-O'Hare. In addition, during the quarter, we completed installation of our high speed Wi-Fi on our entire long-term mainline narrow-body fleet of more than 700 aircrafts. This gives American more high speed Wi-Fi than any other airlines. Satellite-based Wi-Fi allows customers to stream video without buffering or interruption upload and download files with ease and do all of this from gate-to-gate. This upgraded bandwidth ensures customers will experience an uncompromised Internet connection even if every customer chooses to access in-flight entertainment at the same time. Additionally every satellite equipped aircraft can now stream Live TV and amenity that we provide access to our customers' free-of-charge. I should also point out that American is the only U.S. airline to offer Live TV on international flights. Shifting to our network strategy. We remain focused on strengthening our network by expanding operations at our most profitable hubs. With the addition of a 100 departures in the second quarter, our DFW hub now offers more than 900 daily flights. This important milestone enables more than 9,000 one-stop travel possibilities through DFW more than any other airline hub in the world. As part of that growth, we had started service from DFW to 23 new markets including service to Dublin and Munich, and increased service to more than 80 existing markets. This growth marks the largest expansion at any hub in the United States in more than a decade. The early results are very encouraging with margins on the newly added flights coming in at or above the system average. We remain on track with our growth plan in Charlotte next year and Reagan National in 2021. Over the last year, we have also made a number of changes to our International network eliminating chronically underperforming flights and starting services to unserved markets across the world. Most of these new flights started in the middle of the second quarter and they are already producing margins at or above the system average. On the partnership side, we now have final approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation for a proposed joint business agreement with Qantas which will allow us to better serve customers' flying between the United States and Australia and New Zealand. The joint business agreement allows for commercial integration between American and Qantas delivering new routes and significant customer benefits. It will also allow an expanded coacher relationship, optimized schedules on South Pacific services, better access the T20 business carrier's network -- on each carrier's networks additional frequent flier benefits and co-location at airports. All of this is designed to better serve our customers. And just yesterday, Qantas announced new services to Chicago and San Francisco from Brisbane. We are thrilled with this news to our customers and stay tuned for more route announcements from us later this year. We also received approval from the DoT for additional service from DFW and Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda airport. Shifting gears, our global sales and distribution team produced strong results last quarter as corporate revenue growth was in line with system revenue growth on healthy corporate demand. Our corporate volume continues to grow and further strengthened in the last six weeks of the quarter where we delivered industry-leading corporate passenger share performance without sacrificing yield. We continue to see significant growth in the small to medium business segment as evidenced by our nearly double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. We continue to see growth across our loyalty program. Existing members are engaging with us more, redemption levels -- redemption bookings are up and we continue to increase our lead population. Most importantly, we are capturing yield growth in this lead group that outpaces our system average. On co-branded credit cards, our strong trends in acquisitions, card spend, and overall account growth continued in the second quarter with record setting absolute results. We expected that growth will continue throughout 2019. All of this contributed to record setting second quarter revenue of $12 billion, up approximately 3% year-over-year. On a unit revenue basis, total revenue per available seat mile improved 3.5% year-over-year which marks the 11th consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth for American. We estimate that our unit revenue benefited from the MAX cancellations in the second quarter. This benefit was offset by share loss in April. We are particularly pleased with these results given the challenge we had with operational disruptions to MAX and weather. I mentioned this on our last call, but I need to say it again. In 2018, we made a big investment in our Advantage program making it more valuable to customers. We significantly increased the inventory available for redemptions in 2018, increasing the value of amounts to our customers; we are also giving our customers more flexibility to use their miles. For the second quarter, these changes had a negative impact of 0.8 units to unit revenue all of which was non-cash. We anticipate a similar impact for the remainder of the year. Normalizing for this, our passenger unit revenue increased by 4.8% in the second quarter, two points better than our legacy competitors. We delivered improved unit revenue, unit revenue across every entity. As we mentioned on previous calls, we believe we have a unique opportunity to improve load factors without eroding yields and we have been successful in that effort to execute against that opportunity. Overall load factors were up 3.2 points in the quarter on flat yields. Higher loads without compromising yields is a winning combination. We're proud of our revenue management team for their hard work and results. Domestic market strength was broad-based with improved unit revenue across every hub. As I mentioned earlier, our growth at DFW is performing as expected, notwithstanding exceptional operational and weather challenges at DFW during the quarter. We expect the domestic region to be our best performing entity in the third quarter. Atlantic unit revenue grew by 3% in spite of 1.5 points of currency headwind. International point of sale remains challenging but we successfully shifted to North American point-of-sale and grew load factor by 3.8 points. The Latin entity had the highest quarter-to-quarter improvement with unit revenue growing by 4.4% year-over-year. Brazil and Mexico were particularly strong while we faced headwinds in Argentina and the Dominican Republic. Specific unit revenue improved by half point, thanks to positive unit revenue in Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia. The pricing environment for China was soft but we were able to grow load factor while we reduced our capacity and exposure to this market. Looking forward, we expect domestic demand to remain robust. And Latin again to be the best performing international entity. We expect our third quarter year-over-year TRASM to be up 1% to 3% and our passenger revenue per ASM to be about a point better than TRASM. In conclusion, we're incredibly excited about this airline as future; the heavy lifting of integration is behind us, our large fleet investments are winding down, and our network is being optimized with high margin growth opportunities at our most profitable hubs. We recognize the need to overcome some short-term challenges but the core business is strong. And with that, we'd like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Hello, hey good morning everyone. Two questions here and maybe they are both for Robert, at the beginning of the year you were targeting a billion of revenue improvement and $300 million of cost saves and with the MAX groundings and the labor disruption, how should we think about resizing those numbers as we move through the year?\nRobert Isom: Yes, thanks Michael. So when we take a look at the revenue initiatives, we set out at the front of the year, I think the best way to take a look at is some have outperformed and others, we will be able to take a benefit of in the longer-term.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nRobert Isom: One that has really taken a delay is identifying of our 737 and our A321 fleet because of some of the issues that we've encountered with operational disruptions related to the work slowdown, we've had to defer some of those modification lines. We anticipate picking those back up next year and that is benefit yet to come. In terms of outperformance, some of the things that we have really emphasized certainly basic economy is producing as we had hoped and the work within our revenue management team to improve load factor performance has resulted us well. So we're seeing the $1 billion and as we take a look into the future, we're encouraged that we still have more to come. Don, do you want to add anything?\nDon Casey: Yes, I will just re-emphasize what Robert said, again, kind of understand our $1 billion in revenue initiatives and how it compares; you're going to normalize for the deferred recognition rate in FFP. When you do that revenues are 4.8% which is about two points better than our kind of legacy competitors you can see where the benefit is just in there.\nDerek Kerr: And Mike from a cost perspective, we have a lot of initiatives, all of them are on target the $300 million is in the forecast, so that\u2019s all built in and we are realizing those. There are a few cost headwinds obviously as you have these type of disruptions but that's built into the CASM forecasts that I gave you, so that some of them are offset by that. But the initiatives that we set out for the one airline project to get a $1 billion, $300 million this year and then another $200 million in 2020 and 2021 are all on target and are built into our forecast.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Yes sure, it's remarkable given all your headwinds that you still manage to produce margin expansion, so well done there. Just my second to Robert on the JBA with Qantas. I recall a few years back when you announced the joint venture or JBA with Japan Airlines at the time you did provide a revenue size. At that point in time when it was launched, I think it was about a $1.05 billion of revenue between you and JAL and subsequently my sense is that you've built upon that even today you highlighted some of the positive trends out of Japan. I'm sure that's helping. Can you give us a sense or magnitude of where we are from a revenue base as a starting point with Qantas? Just trying to size that joint business agreement, what our baseline is. Any color on that would be great. Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Mike, it's the current size there is $1.5 billion and we don't -- we're really not sizing yet publicly the potential benefits but we do expect that this is going to be something that's positive overall. And I'm pleased with hearing of some new markets. And I would anticipate that we have more to add to that in the coming months.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatt Wisniewski: Hi good morning. This is actually Matt Wisniewski on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. Really wanted just to expand upon the network strategy a little bit more, said it's little bit early and the DFW expansion, how should we kind of think about the improvements coming through and when would we see ultimately kind of some of the benefits hitting at the P&L?\nRobert Isom: Well I will just start. We're just now getting into the real upsizing of DFW which is encouraging. So you're seeing some of the benefits already but the whole run rate of that is going to be as we progress throughout the year. As we take a look forward as I mentioned 2020, we anticipate our growth focus to be on Charlotte and so that will ramp up over the first part of next year. And then from there it's Reagan National after that in 2021. So Don or Doug, do you want to give any more color.\nDon Casey: I will just say this is really just the beginning. We just started ramping up the DFW into 2Q. And we won't see the full benefit of that until we hit the third quarter. That'll obviously extend and annualize as we head into 2020 at which point we'll also be adding Charlotte which will run into 2021 and we will have an opportunity to upgauge DCA. So we have a lot of really high quality capacity network opportunities looking out for the next few years.\nDoug Parker: And Matt it's Doug. I mean as Robert said in his opening remarks, the early results here are really encouraging, these markets that we have added out of Dallas as Robert said are coming in at or above system average margins as a new startup. Usually your marginal growth doesn't come in above average margins in this case they do. That just give us more encouragement to us, there's more -- there's one what we -- we believe will happen is indeed happening and two there's more of this we can do and we're looking forward to doing more as we go forward.\nMatt Wisniewski: Okay, great. And then just as a quick follow-up specific capacity was down quite meaningfully this quarter and I would expect, I thought kind of anticipated revenues to kind of be more beneficial because of that. Can you provide a little more color of what\u2019s going on in the Pacific region?\nDon Casey: Sure, it\u2019s Don. I'll cover that. We did that slightly positive unit revenue in the Pacific. Capacity reductions we had was the reduction of flying to China, out of Chicago, Shanghai and Beijing. We did see actually positive unit revenue growth in Hong Kong, Japan, also in Australia with more opportunities coming forward at Qantas. The China market was soft. It was our weakest performing market in the Pacific. We had about a point and a half of currency headwind as well in the Pacific as we went into the third quarter. And I think we're pretty happy that we kind of reduced our exposure to China because that's really where we're seeing some softness particularly in China upon the sell pricing where we see pretty weak pricing environment right now.\nDoug Parker: And hi Matt, Doug again. So also thanks for asking that question, because it gives us chance to tell more about this. Given the kind of capacity reduction we're talking about here I think it's hard for anyone certainly for those of you who aren't here in the airlines every day to try and estimate what kind of impact that would have between revenue per ASM versus cost per ASM. And indeed when we raised our guidance a couple of weeks ago at least a number of reports suggested well, really -- it's unlike a cost story that we've done a better job of keeping our cost in check with some expected and our revenues came out in line. The reality at least for those of us who are watching results come in, the positive surprises were on revenue, not on cost again not that any of you should be able to figure that out on your own because it is such a different way this happens but indeed when our capacity is going down because we're having to -- because we're canceling flights very close in. What happens then is you're not able to particularly in the peak we're not able to protect all that revenue. So 1.5% decline in capacity does not result in a 1.5% increase in revenue per ASM or anything close to it. And you're not able and it's pretty difficult to go find the marginal revenues or the lower revenue per ASM as you do that. So at any rate that's what we experienced as the quarter came through as even though ASMs were down the fact that our earnings came out better than we thought, it was to us a revenue surprise not a cost surprise.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody and thank you very much for your time. I have two questions. My first question is what percent of your fleet do you normally replace every year and how does this year compare to a normal year?\nDerek Kerr: I wouldn't say percent but we replaced somewhere. It's been a lot more over the past few years. We've taken deliveries of over 100 aircraft a year for many years in a row since we've gotten here for about five years. This year we're replacing about 65. Next year will be about 61 and that includes regional also. So the steady state would be somewhere between 40 and 50 if you cap a -- the average age where it is. So I think that's kind of where we're at. And so when we talk about aircraft CapEx going forward it comes down significantly in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, steady state would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 aircraft a year when you get out into the 2025 to 2030 range.\nDoug Parker: Helane, a good way for us to again make the point, it's a hard question for us because there is no normal. There certainly hasn't been since the merger as Derek said we've been bringing in 85 to 100 airplanes each year and then retiring a similar amount in this by far the most aggressive modernization of a commercial airline fleet in the history of commercial aviation. So that has been the number and that's now largely behind us. So as we've been doing that also the CapEx we've had to put into integration and the CapEx that we put into all the improvements that have been needed to make into our airline that tapers not as strong enough. That comes down significantly as Derek said in the coming years both aircraft CapEx and in some of the non-aircraft CapEx. So we get the benefits of all that investment -- amount of investment in the quarter.\nHelane Becker : Okay. And then, so then to follow that up the $1 billion dollars in debt pay down that I think Derek mentioned, should we think about that as accelerating through the next five or seven years as your kind of steady state declines from 100 aircraft to 50 aircraft?\nDerek Kerr: From a debt pay down perspective, we have our normal debt pay down schedule which is somewhere between $3 billion a year over the next few years, so that pay down does not accelerate. I think there are pay down of WTCs and other debts that we have. But as you look at our pay down schedule from in 2019, we'll pay off $3.7 billion of debt in 2020, we have $2.7 billion due, 2021 we have $4.2 billion due. So it runs around $3 billion to $4 billion of debt that's paid off. That scheduled debt pay downs that go along with the pension payments but that's all in the numbers that Doug talked about when we talk about free cash flow that's all assumed that those debt payments are paid in each one of those years and that we pay off debt as it comes due.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Thanks. Good morning everybody. A question about that comment you made about the market share loss in April. Can you give me some color on that comment what you mean by that? Where was it? What type of share was it? And how do you get that back?\nDon Casey: Sure, Hunter, it\u2019s Don. When we had ended up grounding the MAX, there was a lot of schedule uncertainty as to how long this was going to last and how we're going to move aircraft around to try and cover this. And so during that period sort of really starting mid-March through what the third week in April, we did see close in bookings and close-in bookings particularly for corporate travel lag, right. So we definitely lost share. We definitely saw some book away during that time period to our competitors. That did bounce back by the time we got through April and in fact, if you look at the last six weeks of our kind of corporate share performance, we are number one in the industry in terms of corporate share. So that's really complete bounce back for us. But it was entirely just a response to schedule uncertainty, if you wanted to get your meeting during that time period sometimes people are choosing not to fly, so they weren't sure whether they're going to change our scheduling.\nHunter Keay: Okay, fair enough. Thank you, Don. And then, Doug, when you think about the relationship between employees buying in reliable operations and consistent cost performance that's arguably the three areas that you guys need to show the most improvement. And if we assume all three of those things kind of feed into one another which order do they have to get fixed and how do you get started with the first one?\nDoug Parker: Employee buying in and then reverse.\nHunter Keay: Either way I mean you can define in any order you want. So it's buy in operations and just good cost performance, so like which one has to start first and which one sort of manifest into the other two getting better and how do you start it?\nDoug Parker: Yes. I will start on -- I'm not exactly sure I'd characterize it that way but I'd love to talk about the employee perspective, you're getting again I mean first of all let me just go to the operations. In this -- we as a company and under Robert's leadership have made great strides in our operations reliability from the time emerging airlines improving every year up until 2018, we had a setback last summer unrelated -- related primarily to things like six engines, things we tried to do our best to fly through and didn't make change to the schedule and in retrospect, we realized that we were kind of letting the operation to be the buffer not something go. In retrospect we would have made the same decision going forward.  So in response to that, we put in place again with Robert's leadership, David Seymour's leadership, Carey\u2019s leadership a huge operational reliability improvement plan for 2019. And again we did those things that made a large difference in our ability to manage through what we're dealing with now. So we feel really good about where we are in terms of operational reliability but for, what we're dealing with at the current time which is a huge increase in the aircraft out of service to begin the day. That when we're as we are today having to start the day with so many airplanes -- more airplanes out of service than we have spares. By definition that means you're starting the day by canceling some flights and by definition that means it's not going to be a particularly good operating reliability. So that's the situation with operational reliability. Not to say there's not more we can do and won't do to improve it. But once that issue -- once that issue is removed, I'll say it this way we believe it will work for that issue. We would be running the best airline in the history of American Airlines which was our goal for this year. And all the data that we have supports that. As Robert noted, we're seeing that on the regional side where we don't have this issue. So operational reliability, I feel extremely good about where we are and our trajectory going forward. We do need to get to the near-term issue. So as it relates to culture anyway I think I know -- I guess you're getting out or maybe not, if it's not you tell me. But anyway, it's a fair question and thanks for asking how what we're going through relates to all the work we have underway on cultural transformation. I will tell you the cultural initiatives that we've put in place since the time of the merger. And again remember back when we put these two airlines together five-and-a-half years ago, how big an issue that was particularly given the history of American Airlines and those things are working, we've made huge strides thanks to really good leadership. The people that I get to work with, who led our team, who every time that I most -- when I go out and talk to team members prior to the merger, it was all about this company doesn't care about me. Now as we go out and talk to people, we still have issues but they're rarely that actually they aren't that. To the extent, their issues they're all about desire for more tools to do the job, the way they know how to do it to take care of their customers which is exactly where you'd like the team. And exactly what our job is to deliver to them. So look there's more to do there with cultural transformation obviously takes some time, it takes a lot of time. But we're really pleased with the progress we've made to-date and we'll continue to make in the future. Our objective here is to make culture a competitive advantage not just to improve the culture, not just to transform it from what wasn't a very strong one to one is really strong but to make it so strong that people actually prefer to fly American. That's not -- that's not -- we're not there yet. That's aspirational and longer-term objective. One we are committed to and one that we think is best for our shareholders. So that work continues but really happy with the progress. I think again fair to ask, if that's the case and why are you going to this issue right now to which side -- to which I would tell you look, while that culture work goes on, there's no change the fact that this is a highly unionized airline and union negotiations will continue to be union negotiations and some of them we haven't even gotten through the first one yet. And this is one amazingly enough, this is we're still working on joint collective bargaining agreement with this Union and we hopefully to get that done. We obviously get them done quite quickly with all of our other workers. And indeed we're beginning negotiations on contracts that we signed five years ago JVs with pilots and flight attendants today. So it's a source of frustration for sure. And but look this is a different animal one that we're still trying to work through. But unlike the other contracts we work through, we're dealing with two Unions here chose to form one Union and sign association partnership. We're dealing with international Unions where the primary decision makers aren't even American Airlines team members. So the culture doesn't make that much of a difference as far as they're concerned. So look we will work through this, we'll get through a contract and that's the real goal here of course is to make sure we get a contract in place when we do that. We're going to have a long-term contract with our outstanding mechanics and fleet service team members. That's going to be industry-leading and that will be a good day. So that'll help significantly but we need to get through this joint agreement with this group. And right now we haven\u2019t been able to get through that. I will add I'm sorry for the long answer but I will add on that front, certainly with the way we get into a joint collective bargaining agreement is to get back to talking to each other. These negotiations are under the control of the National Mediation Board at this time which is a good thing; the bad thing is the National Mediation Board hasn't called a negotiating session since April because of that. You can ask them why but the fact is they haven't. And as a result we haven't -- we haven't had talks good news as we just heard last night from the NMB, they'd like to have a status conference with all of us on August 15th. That's really good news. By that time we think we'll probably have a permanent injunction in place which will help with what we're dealing with. The goal of this is not to have people coming to work and doing their jobs because the goal is we have people coming to work and doing their jobs because we are excited about the company and the future of the company. And to do that we need to get a contract in place. We're trying to do that. We're working extremely hard at it and I know that we'll get one. I can't tell you exactly when we will get to a contract and this issue that we're dealing with today will be behind us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDoug Parker: Hi Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey thanks, good morning. Sorry if I missed it in your prepared remarks but when do you expect a decision on the injunction?\nDoug Parker: Steve Johnson?\nSteve Johnson: Hi, you never know for sure but my guess would be late next week or early the week after that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you. And then just as a follow-up as you think about this cost of the MAX grounding which you've estimated at $400 million relative to perhaps your future aircraft order book value of about $3.5 billion, is the right way to think about potential compensation as a discount to that future value to maybe 10% to 12% discount on your existing order book as we sit here today?\nDoug Parker: We wouldn't encourage you to think about it in anyway because we don't know; we haven't had any discussions with our partners at Boeing about the details of how this compensation might occur. We saw as I know you did, they satisfied they put a reserve aside. We've had high level conversations with the highest levels of Boeing about what our expectations are but we haven't had any detailed conversations about how those expectations will be met.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.\nDan McKenzie: Hey thanks. Good morning. Healthy corporate demand that's strengthened the last six weeks in the quarter despite some severe operational disruptions that's a surprise. But we know there's a direct link between business travel and operations. So the idea book away when operations are bad. So the question is I wonder if you can elaborate on any book away challenges in the third quarter outlook, how they might be a headwind or an opportunity at some point here and does the current outlook embed some book away?\nDoug Parker: Thanks. I will let Dan give you the specifics but again I just want to reiterate just what Robert said in his comments. While this is going on our team is doing really, really great work to make sure while we have operational disruption. It's not felt nearly to a degree it would be otherwise by our customers first and foremost is once we realize that this was well a near-term issue, one that was going to be going on for a matter of weeks and months, we begun the process and that continues not waiting until the day of to do cancellations but do them several days in advance that allows us to reaccommodate customers again not the best thing you want to do but much better than having customers find that their travel has been disrupted on the day of the airport. So that makes a big difference and then as we do that particularly as it relates and Robert trying to tell more about this probably isn't reached through our most frequent fliers making sure that they are having -- they are having the least impact of all and to the extent they are, they know that the company is reaching out to them. So we're working really hard on those issues. Don, is there anything in terms of?\nDon Casey: Yes, I will just add that. We have actually been tracking completion factor for our corporate customers which is we have been canceling flights but kind of which flights we are cancelling relative to that kind of travel patterns of our corporate customers on a year-over-year basis. There has not been a very material change in the completion factor for corporate customers. So we've done a good job of figuring out kind of what to cancel as it pertains to the outlook, we aren't really seeing anything right now that would cause any book away and we expect our performance for domestic in the third quarter to be pretty similar maybe even a touch better than it was in the second quarter.\nDerek Kerr: I'll just give a shout out to our sales team and our customer relations team as well with any issues; we have opened up new means of communicating to ensure that any issues are addressed. And I've also stepped up our efforts to be out there with our corporate clients and that includes our Head of Sales Allison Taylor and myself and a number of the other executives here. So we're hearing firsthand of where the issues as we can get in front of them whenever possible.\nDan McKenzie: Very good. Good job, second question here is we do have a tale of two economies. Obviously, we've got the industrial which is slowing and the consumer which is strong and we've seen this in prior years as well and I guess I'm just wondering if you can talk about how you think one affecting the other at some point if they do, what are the key metrics that give you confidence that demand can continue to remain firm here and at this point are you sort of revising any implicit fourth quarter revenue assumptions?\nDon Casey: Again if you don\u2019t look at kind of what's been happening, right. We've seen some softness right in international fund sales, right. Some of that's currency. Some of that's economy. But the domestic market has remained very robust. We've been able to backfill really any international shortfalls with higher yielding domestic originating business. And we've been able to successfully grow our load factor maturely, we are up actually two points overall in the second quarter and we're up really in every entity. As we look forward, I mean we're actually booked ahead as we look forward into future months and we're not seeing really anything that wouldn't make us concerned at this point around continued strength in domestic demand.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey good morning everybody. Most of my questions have been asked and well answered. So one from me, I know it's the view of your aviators that some of the reliability issues are related to scheduling practices and maybe some IP deficiencies. This is a difficult one for me to reconcile with the data that I have access to. So I guess the question is whether you believe, are you extracting all the potential efficiency of the current pilot contract and whether there is some IP investment that does need to be made if so what might that cost?\nDerek Kerr: So Jamie thanks for the question. That's the good news at least for all of us in this, there is I still believe a tremendous upside so in our operation. So while we are dealing with the mechanic slowdown in weather anomalies, and you name it we're finally getting the chance to run an integrated airline and as we do that with all of our systems, we're able to move past the point of just integration to taking a look at what the next generation of systems are. So when we take a look at scheduling practices, we know that there are potential efficiencies that we can bring about that potentially saves on flight times. We know that for our pilots and flight attendants that there are ways that we can meet their needs in actually creating more lifestyle, improved schedules that should also reduce the impact of redundancies and reserve levels. And we know that there's a lot more work that we can do on aircraft routing as well now that we have the system all in one place. And don't forget even when it comes to maintenance operations, we still are operating with a couple of different systems out there. So restricting ourselves in some way, so more upside is how I view things and thanks for bringing it up because I think the opportunity for investment is good and the payoff will be nice when we get to it.\nJamie Baker: Any guess on timing and thank you very much.\nDerek Kerr: So in terms of timing, 2020 will be a year in which we have our eyes firmly on operations improvement especially in regard to efficiency. So it's going to be over the next few years. There are some larger longer-term issues in terms of flight management systems and crew scheduling systems where we'll have to move past some of the legacy systems and think about next-generation. But there's many improvements we can make along the way and Maya do you want to add any here?\nMaya Leibman: No, I think we are always working on improving our systems. It's just an ongoing aspect of what we do.\nJamie Baker: Okay, thank you.\nDerek Kerr: The good news for us is we have a lot of upside here.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nKevin Crissey: Hey good morning everybody. Thank you for the time. Maybe if I could ask you to fast forward past this week, we've surpassed this being the MAX, the mechanics let's look out whether it'd be 2020 or 2021 but let's just if we can start with 2020 not looking for specific guidance by any stretch at all but broad strokes as to what all the changes in 2019 does to your 2020 capacity cost structure, should we see the kind of the inverse of the negative impacts in 2019 as it relates to 2020 on a year-over-year basis. How should we think about that?\nDoug Parker: Well without giving any guidance to you guys we haven't -- we're not prepared to give just yet. On a global basis and I think in terms of what it means for growth next year, it's certainly two things going on one you have growth being stifled this year for these issues that won't. And then on top of that, we've told you the growth that we've put in place, the growth that we plan to put in place is doing exceptionally well. So you should expect us to continue along that. So this will be -- will certainly be a growing airline as we move into 2020. And then what that means again setting aside economic issues that may or may not happen, what it means for us, we think is the ability to certainly view the industry is probably the best way to think about it because who knows what happens to global issues vis-\u00e0-vis the industry and now we think as that happens for all the reasons, we've talked for a lot of the reason we talked about which is upside that Robert is talking about, I think we would hope that on that growth, you'd see our unit revenues improve at a rate that's greater even than the industry. And our cost as Derek has described staying well in check. And that should result in things like we would hope margin improvement and certainly improve -- more improvement than the group in total. And If I'm remotely right about that because of what they're striving in terms of our CapEx profile that that results in real cash flow generation and certainly more than I think you'll see from our competitors.\nKevin Crissey: Yes, thank you for that. And we are obviously looking for a good CASM next year; I've been a little hopeful that it would be this year. Wasn't sure about next year, this maybe creates the opportunity for that. Go ahead, I'm sorry.\nDoug Parker: More to come on that, we agree.\nKevin Crissey: Okay, thank you. And maybe for Don, can you talk about the transatlantic outlook. There's been some commentary about it being softer. Maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks or during Q&A and if it is softer as we look to Q3 and beyond, why that's the case?\nDon Casey: Sure. I guess here is the way I would describe it. We've seen some softness again in Europe point-of-sale in terms of both demand and yields. Again the domestic markets been strong. We've been able to backfill that in growing unit revenue. Again we were up 3% in the second quarter and that's what one and half points of currency headwind. Third quarter, we don't have quite as much headroom in the load factor side year-over-year. But if you go and look out into the fourth quarter on the Atlantic industry capacity is growing at the lowest rate since it hasn't since 2012. So we are really seeing kind of moderating and lower industry capacity. And in particular, the capacity that's coming out of the Atlantic as we head into the fall and winter is really low cost carrier, low price carriers right that are taking the capacity out. So I think the Atlantic although it's -- we see softness in Europe point-of-sale. I think the capacity profile as we move forward is actually quite positive and we would expect that to start to translate into improved yields in the economy cabin as we head into the next winter.\nKevin Crissey: Excellent. Thanks. And if I could sneak in one more with -- you haven't talked about Miami. When we look at the data, the South Florida region looks soft internationally. Is that kind of an area of weakness for you? You talked a lot about regions that were above system average. I assume that might be one that might be below?\nDon Casey: No actually been quite good for us. Actually for us Miami is our gateway to Latin America. Brazil was very, very strong, Caribbean was good, Mexico was very, very strong. We had over 20% revenue growth in Mexico. And so our profile in Miami actually is -- actually we're quite encouraged by Miami. And it was actually our best performing unit revenue in the third quarter or second quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Okay. And our first question from the media comes from Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg News. Your line is open.\nMary Schlangenstein: I wanted to see Don, you've been talking a lot about demand but can you talk a little bit more in detail about domestic demand whether you're surprised at how it's held up and specifically what you think is fueling that ongoing strong demand?\nDon Casey: I mean, domestic demand has been strong now for a long time, right. This is something that just happened overnight. And as I mentioned earlier when we look at going forward, we expect that we're seeing nothing right off the trend line that we've seen for domestic. So again I don't think we can type anything, kind any recency in terms of anything that's happened domestic has been in this place now for quite a while and then there's nothing again that we see that's going to take us off this trend line.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. And if I can also ask about the A321neo delays, JetBlue talked this week about hearing of additional delays from Airbus. And can you talk about where you guys are at. How many planes you've had delayed and if there have been any additional either time delays or aircraft delays for you?\nDerek Kerr: Mary, this is Derek. We have not heard of any additional delays. We had conversations with Airbus probably a month ago and we looked at the schedule and got those deliveries all set up as part of the XLR negotiations. So that's been set. I haven't heard of any further delays at this point in time but we'll check back in with Airbus after hearing those conversations to make sure that our aircraft are as planned from our XLR negotiations where we re-spread them a little bit from the original delivery dates.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. Can you say how many A321neos are involved?\nDerek Kerr: It's more like there's about I think there was five to 10 that just got delayed and then they just pushed the whole schedule out a little bit. So somewhere in that range or the amount that have been delayed but what we did is as part of our negotiations, is just re-spread them to put them in order where Airbus can deliver and we can plan a little bit better.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Chris [indiscernible] from CBS News. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Guys thanks for the time today. Real quick, can you talk about you mentioned that you're having to cancel some flights in [indiscernible]?\nDoug Parker: Hi Chris, we completely lost you.\nUnidentified Analyst: I was asking how many flights you had to cancel because the mechanics issue if you have added daily number we\u2019ve seen where you are to that in addition to the MAX?\nDon Casey: Chris, so what I tell you is as Doug mentioned every morning we're seeing a lot of more aircraft out of service than had been planned and we're taking actions to address that. So I can't give you a specific number everyday but it's certainly been impactful, the operation in some days we've gotten it most days we were way in front of it. So that we're addressing customers' needs. But that can be in the number -- it can be in the dozens of flights a day.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And when you look at correctly the MAX Southwest puts it back in January. How confident are you in November timeline. Obviously confident enough you didn't change it but did you see that as realistic before the holidays. Or you have some level of expectation that lingers into January?\nDon Casey: We're staying in close contact with both Boeing and the FAA. And I think is up to speed as anybody and as matter of fact Boeing had their earnings call yesterday and I was in touch with their team last night afterwards. So from what we heard a month or so ago we really haven't -- we don't have any new information leads us to make changes. But we're staying close and we'll certainly assess based on what we know today, we should be able to hit the timeline of being back up in November.\nDoug Parker: We will continue to reassess as we move forward. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison [indiscernible] of Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. I was curious if you could say whether you've had any -- done any additional work looking at how customers are feeling about the MAX right now. Do you have the sense that sentiment has evolved one way or the other as the grounding instruction?\nDoug Parker: Allison we don't really have any answer to that directly that question is no, we don't have anything specific to give you any insight. Certainly what we know is this, when the FAA declares that this aircraft is safe to fly, it will be safe to fly and when American pilots declare that they are comfortable flying, it will fly. And what I know is our customers will view those two things as extremely important in their view about whether or not the airplane is safe to fly. And so until that time, I'm certain there any customer survey data would show some concerns. I believe once we get to that point those will be largely mitigated and certainly well over time but nothing that we can tell you specifically today about where they are.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it, thanks. And I guess is there anything you're hoping from Boeing in terms of sort of like rehabilitating its brand or restoring trust and confidence in aircraft. Is there anything you're hoping they'll do on that front?\nDoug Parker: Again what is most important to us is that the airplane has been recertified and because the FAA has come to the conclusion that everything that led them to ground the aircraft has been mitigated. When that happens and our pilots believe they are adequately trained to fly the aircraft and has now -- has been certified. That's what we are focused upon and we believe those two set of events more than anything else will make the difference in our consumer attitudes about the aircraft itself.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Koenig of The Associated Press. Your line is open.\nDavid Koenig: Hi, good morning. I'm sorry. I'm going to probably kick the same dead horse that Allison was kicking. But let me put it another way. Well first of all, Doug, if you could explain a little bit more you said that you had some conversations with the highest levels of Boeing about what your expectations are relating to compensation. Can you say that's new to [indiscernible] or something less than that. If it's Robert talking to somebody or whatever. And then secondly what's your campaign going to be to convince passengers to get on the plane beyond FAA and your pilot showing confidence in the plane what are you going to do?\nDoug Parker: David, no further information on who's talking to who. Anyway we have a great relationship with Boeing and they're a great partner and we didn\u2019t suspect they will continue to be great partners as we work through all of this. We certainly have been today. So that's where we are with as it relates to Boeing and again --\nRobert Isom: And Dave, I just say that one piece of planning that I think is noteworthy is that, we anticipate sometime between the aircraft being ungrounded and when we actually put the aircraft into commercial service where our pilots and flight attendants will get reacquainted with the aircraft and will actually be flying some level of our team members around. And so I think that that is going to be helpful. But as Doug has said the biggest thing is having our pilots and flight attendants and team all behind this and ultimately flying this aircraft is going to be something that is going to be a big part of our fleet. And we look forward to taking advantage of all the capabilities that it offers once it's recertified.\nDavid Koenig: Are you going to have any kind of advertising campaign though?\nRobert Isom: We don't anticipate that at this time. Again I think the biggest thing is being able to provide really comfortable and certainly reliable service and that's what when this aircraft is recertified and our team members are out behind it. And I think that that will be something that is a hallmark of this aircraft going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Your line is open.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi good morning everybody. Just a question on hiring Southwest talks about some issues with hiring pilots because of the 737 MAX grounding and some promotion classes. Are you seeing anything similar with that?\nRobert Isom: No. The good news is that American is a fantastic place to work and we have really for all categories of our team members. We have people that want to join the team and we're certainly monitoring the pilot sourcing for our regional carriers. But we feel really confident there as well that we have the scheduling practices and compensation tools to be able to track the team members that we need.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. And just one follow-up for passengers who maybe don't want to fly the MAX once it returns or maybe wait a few months for it to fly safely. Is there any way that they can get out of those reservations or without paying a change fee or cancellation fee; is that something you're looking at this from some of the other airlines as well?\nRobert Isom: Like others we will be sure to make the appropriate accommodations but over the long run, this is an aircraft that is going to be out in service and flying well and we anticipate that everybody's needs to be taken care of.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Doug Parker for the closing remarks.\nDoug Parker: Excellent. Thanks everybody. Thanks for your interest and thanks for sticking with us through this. Any further questions let either Corporate Communications or Investor Relations now. Thanks for your time. Bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."}, {"symbol": "AAL", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-04-26 19:12:20", "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentleman. And welcome to the American Airlines First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Cravens, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDan Cravens: Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the American Airlines Group's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us in the room this morning is Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Finance Officer. Also in the room for our question-and-answer session are several of our senior exes, including Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs, Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the first quarter and provide some additional information on our 2019 guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then, after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions, and then lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please do limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast or capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and that can also be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on the website, the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us. At this point, I\u2019d like to the turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Dan. And thank you all for being on the line. I need to start by thanking our 130,000 team members for the outstanding job they did of taking care of our customers and each other during some really difficult circumstances. Robert, we'll talk more about disruption. The 737 MAX issue is caused to our customers and team members, but our team has responded remarkably and our customers and our shareholders are the beneficiaries of that work, so we are extremely grateful. As your earnings we announced this morning pre-tax results from the quarter of $314 million in profits ex specials, which is $0.52 a share. As we head into or begin to prepare for the peak summer travel season, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, demand for our product is high. Our near-term forecast though has been up - has been affected by the 737 MAX grounding, which we currently estimate will negatively impact. Our 2019 pre-tax results by approximately $350 million and that assumes they were - they are flying as we currently have them scheduled again by August 19. And the recent bounceback in oil prices hasn't helped either. Our current estimate for 2019 fuel expense is approximately $650 million higher than it was when we spoke on this call just three months ago. But despite these challenges, we're still - anticipate our 2019 EPS to increase approximately 10% versus 2018. And as we look to 2020 and beyond we anticipate our free cash flow for production will increase significantly, as our historic fleet replacement program winds down. So we're really bullish on American Airlines and on AAL as ever is - evidence in the quarter by us purchasing approximately $600 million of American Airlines equity. So with that intro, I am going to turn it over to Derek to go through a lot more the numbers and then Robert will take you through more analysis as well. Derek?\nDerek Kerr: Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning everyone. And before I begin I'd like to recognize our team also who did a great job taking care of our customers during the quarter despite a number of challenges, including a government shut down, challenging storms at are largest hubs and obviously the grounding of our 737 MAX fleet, dealing with these issues has not been easy and they\u2019ve done it with professionalism and commitment. So from all of us, thank you for all of your efforts. We filed our first quarter 2019 earnings press release this morning, excluding net special items we reported a first quarter net profit of $237 million, this is versus $353 million in the first quarter of 2018. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding special items in the first quarter was $0.52 per share, down from $0.74 cents per share in the first quarter of 2018. Our first quarter 2019 pre-tax profit excluding net special items was $314 million resulting in a pre-tax margin of 3%. Before I give more details on our financial performance, I'd like to provide an update on our fleet. As you are aware on March 7, 2019 we announced the unplanned removal of 14 737 800 aircraft from service for remediation work, following the installation of new aircraft interiors, resulting in the cancellation of approximately 940 flights in the quarter. Work on these aircraft has been completed and all aircraft have been returned to service. In addition on March 13th, 2019 the FAA grounded all U.S. registered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Our fleet currently includes 24 Boeing Max 8 aircraft with an additional 76 aircraft on order. As a result of the grounding we canceled approximately 12 hundred flights in the first quarter. In aggregate we estimate that these groundings - grounded aircraft and associated flight cancellations negatively impacted first quarter pre-tax income by approximately $80 million, 50 of that million is attributed to the MAX. We have now removed all 737 MAX flying from our schedule through August 19th resulting in the cancellation of approximately 115 flights per day or approximately 2% percent of debate daily capacity during the summer period. Although these aircraft represent a small portion of the company's total fleet, the financial impact is disproportionate as most of the revenue from the cancellations is lost, while the vast majority of the costs remain in place. In total, we presently estimate that 737 MAX cancellations which we assume right now will extend only through August 19th to impact our 2019 pre-tax earnings by approximately $350 million dollars. Despite the challenges of our fleet, our total revenues were a record for the first quarter at $10.6 billion or a 1.8% increase over the first quarter of 2018. Our total RASM was up for the 10th consecutive quarter as RASM increased 0.5% to $15.87, also a record for the first quarter. This revenue growth was driven in part by the continued success of our basic and premium economy products, as well as initiatives to drive higher load factors in the shoulder periods, all of which helped grow passenger revenues by 1.95 to $9.7 billion in the first quarter. Our cargo yields grew by 5.5% for the quarter, but a reduction in available cargo capacity due to reductions in our flying to China and Latin America meant that cargo revenues were down 4% to $218 million. Our loyalty program continues to drive revenue growth and other revenues were higher by 1.9% to $708 million for the quarter on higher card acquisitions. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2019 were $10.2 billion, up 2 percent when fuel and special items are excluded, our unit costs increase in the first quarter by 2.7% compared to 2018, due primarily to increased maintenance expense, contractual increases in salaries and benefits, facility rents and depreciation and amortization. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $7.2 billion in total available liquidity, so far this year our treasury team has completed a number of transactions, including securing financing for 30 new aircraft through mortgage and sale leaseback transactions. With the exception - with the exception of three regional aircraft delivering in the fourth quarter we have committed financing for all aircraft deliveries through 2019 and we have committed financing for 25 of our 2020 deliveries. We continue to evaluate financing options for our remaining mainline and regional aircraft deliveries. We made contributions of $364 million to our defined benefit pension plans in the first quarter for 2019 we still expect total contributions for the year to be approximately $800 million. Driven by strong asset performance in the first quarter we estimated that the funding status of our plans has improved by over $300 million as of March 31 compared to year end or approximately 380 basis points. In the first quarter, our debt including pensions continued to decline driven by contributions to our pension plans and through debt amortization. We continue to expect that our 2019 year end debt \u2013 were compared to year in 2018. As the elevated CapEx associated with our re-fleeting [ph] program ends after this year, we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. We remain committed to returning cash above our target liquidity to shareholders, as market conditions merit. During the first quarter we repurchased 16.7 million shares for $600 million bringing our share count to 444 million, a 41% decline in the share count since the merger in 2013. Our available authorization for stock buybacks is now 1.1 billion and expires at the end of 2020. We filed our investor update this morning, which include our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2019 Due to the ongoing impact of the grounding of our MAX fleet, we now anticipate capacity growth of approximately 2.5% for the full year and approximately 0.7% in the second quarter. While lower than our original plan this capacity growth will still allow us to fully execute our growth plans at our DFW hub which will be the primary driver of our ASM growth for the rest of the year. For the full year we now expect that our 2019 cost per ASM, excluding fuel special items and new labor deals will grow by approximately 2.5%, driven primarily by increases in maintenance expenses, higher regional costs due to volume of flying, higher airport rent expense and contractual salary and benefit increases. This 50 basis point increase from previous gains is solely due to the reduction in ASM growth that I mentioned earlier. Due to lower ASMs in the second and third quarters, we now expect that our CASM will increase by approximately 4.5% in a - in the in the second quarter with growth of approximately 3% in the third quarter, fourth quarter guidance remains unchanged at approximately a 0.5%. Fuel price increases - increased sharply during the first quarter of 2019. We are forecasting that our average fuel price will be between $2.14 and $2.19 per gallon for the second quarter of 2019 and $2.13 to $2.18 for the full year. Our anticipated consolidated fuel expense for the full year is now approximately $650 million dollars higher than our expectations at the start of the year. For revenue we expect that our total revenue per ASM will grow by between 1% and 3% in the second quarter. Robert will provide more detail on the revenue environment in his remarks. But given the cost guidance I outlined above, we expect that our second quarter pre-tax margin, excluding that special items will be between 7% and 8 \u2013 7% and 9%. Had we not had the impact of the mass cancellations on the second quarter, we would have forecasted year over year margin expansion. Due to the impact of the grounding of our MAX, which is fleet - which is about $0.60 per diluted share and the significant increase in fuel expense for the full year which is about a $1.25 per share, we now anticipate that are our earnings per diluted share excluding special items will be between $4 and $6 per share in 2019, an increase of approximately 10% at the midpoint over our 2018 adjusted earnings per share. We still anticipate that we will see margins expansion in the back half of the year. We continue to anticipate an incremental $1 billion in revenue improvements and $300 million in cost reductions from a one airline cost initiatives in 2019. However with fuel expenses where it is currently forecasted for the remainder of the year we plan to take another look at all of our initiatives and our growth plan \u2013 at our planned growth in the second half of the year in 2020. We have revised our expectations for aircraft CapEx in 2019 which now anticipate it will be $2.7 billion, down from $3 billion in previous guidance, due primarily to the late delivery of 5 A321 neo aircraft that will now be received in 2020. As a result of the delay of the neo deliveries into 2020, total CapEx will now expect it to be $4.4 billion in 2019, $3.6 billion in 2020 and remain unchanged in 2021 at $2.2 billion. So far 2019 has presented some unexpected challenges, but our team has responded admirably to take care of our customers and each other. We are excited by the opportunities we have to grow our business for the rest of 2019 and beyond. And we look forward to executing on all of our plans. With that, I will turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Derek and good morning everyone. Before I begin I'd like to thank our team members for doing a great job of taking care of our customers. Their dedication and commitment to delivering outstanding customer service was a crucial component in our ability to generate record first quarter revenues. This was no easy task, particularly given the challenges we faced with our fleet and weather. As we prepare for summer, our focus is around planning for the busiest travel period of the year. And as Derek mentioned, on April 14th we made the decision to extend the cancellations of our Boeing 737 MAX aircraft through August 19th. Our team has done a remarkable job of taking care of our customers and it's been a real challenge given the magnitude of this disruption. For flights through August 19th, we have had to re accommodate almost 700,000 customers, 700,000 customers from almost 150,000 MAX cancellations. And it's not just our passengers. It's literally thousands of our crew members that have had their work schedules altered on very short notice. And that means that our reservations, customer relations and crew resources teams have been working non-stop and overtime to take care of our customers and team. So again, from all of us to our colleagues, thank you. Based upon our ongoing work with the FAA and Boeing, we are confident that the MAX will be recertified prior to August 19th. But by extending our cancellations through the summer, we can plan more reliably for the peak travel season and provide confidence to our customers and team members that we will operate our planned schedule. Once the MAX is recertified, we anticipate bringing these aircraft back into service as spares to supplement our operation as needed during the summer. As we have discussed on past earnings calls, we have several initiatives to improve our operating reliability. The initiatives we are undertaking are making sure that our aircraft are ready to start the day, depart on time and then turn throughout the day on schedule. We also continue to evaluate and refine our planning processes to ensure that we are ready to deliver better service during our peak travel periods throughout the year. But we still have a lot of work to do, I am pleased to report that despite the challenges we have had with our fleet, we've improved our competitive position for reliability. Our relative on time performance, completion factor both improved. We've seen particularly strong performance from our Northeast hubs and Philadelphia, DCA, LaGuardia and JFK. And our regional operations have been outstanding, delivering the expected results from our continued investment in the regional fleet, the simplification of our Eagle partner portfolio and performance initiatives to ensure consistency across the regional business. We've made steady improvements in our international wide body performance as well, delivering the best quarter of on time performance in our history and we're setting new reliability records for our cargo customers as well. On the product side, we have continued to take big steps forward in creating a world class customer experience. During the first quarter, we opened newly renovated Admirals Clubs in Boston and Charlotte, nearly doubling the seating capacity and our renovation project in Pittsburgh just finished up last week. We will also be growing our network of flagship first dining and flagship lounges with DFW opening later in the second quarter. During the first quarter, we announced new innovative and exclusive partnerships that further differentiate American from competition with a private suite at Los Angeles International Airport and with Blade, a helicopter transfer service at both LAX and JFK. These new partnerships further enhance American's already well-known five star service offerings for premium customers. In addition, we announced an enhanced partnership with Hyatt Hotels. Elite members in both the advantage and world of Hyatt loyalty programs will be rewarded with more ways to earn points, miles and status on qualifying American flights and Hyatt hotel stays. On the digital front, in-flight Wi-Fi has long been a frustration for our airline customers, as slow speeds and frequent outages had made for a difficult experience. This is no longer the case with American. We have now have \u2013 we now have the bandwidth to meet their needs, our customer's needs, as our installations of high speed Wi-Fi throughout our domestic - our domestic fleet are nearly complete. We've also activated free live TV on nearly all of our mainline aircraft and we continue to be the only U.S. carrier to offer live television on international flights. In addition, we launched the new exclusive partnership with Apple, giving our customers access to Apple Music to stream more than 50 songs, playlist and music videos on any domestic flight equipped via Satellite Wi-Fi. These are just a few of the examples of the investments that we have made in our product that further differentiate American from the competition. As we look to our network, we are leveraging our strengths with high margin growth planned at our DIA Dallas/Fort Worth and Charlotte hubs. The first stage of that growth commences in May where we'll begin using our 15 new gates at DFW, which will add approximately 100 departures per day. We've already begun selling tickets to 23 new routes and additional frequencies in over 70 markets. And the early results are encouraging, as both bookings and yields are coming in at rates higher than the system average. This marks the first opportunity for significant growth at one of our most profitable hubs. We are excited about adding this capacity particularly into the diverse and robust North Texas economy, which is one of the fastest growing regions in the U.S. We remain on track with our growth plans in Charlotte for 2020 and at our hub in Washington DCA in 2021. Our local sales and distribution team produced strong results last quarter, as corporate revenue growth outpaced system revenue growth on a healthy corporate demand and improved corporate fair environment. The team continues to execute on making American Airlines the easiest airline to do business with, including recent corporate recognition enhancements. Corporate customers now receive complimentary priority access, which includes a priority check in, priority security and group for boarding and during irregular operations, corporate customers now receive a higher prioritization for re-accommodation. Working with our Corporate Customer Advisory Board, we received guidance and feedback on this and other strategic initiatives, solidifying American Airlines as the preferred airline for business travellers. The first quarter was also another record breaking quarter for new corporate account acquisitions, ensuring a strong and healthy pipeline for future corporate growth. Based on our recent corporate customer survey 90% of respondents said that they plan to increase or maintain their spend in 2019, as compared to last year. So we feel confident about corporate demand for the remainder of the year. In loyalty, we continue to see strong growth in advantage fliers, along with more customers qualifying for elite status with year over year yield improvements exceeding system increases. We are also seeing strong growth in redemption bookings. We set first quarter records for acquisitions and spend on our advantage credit cards. And we expect that to carry forward for the full year. As we've previously mentioned, the enhancements to our city advantage platinum card and the introduction of the no fee mile up card last year have increased customer engagement in both acquisitions and retention. This quarter we're excited to announce new benefits for our Barclays Red and Silver Aviator Cards, beginning on May 1st. New card features include an annual companion certificate and enhancements to the travel experience with credits for onboard Wi-Fi and food and beverages. With these changes, we believe we offer an unrivaled portfolio of cards to engage a broad range of customers. Our product segmentation strategy continues to provide choice for our customers and drive incremental revenue for the company. With our premium economy retrofit program now complete American has more aircraft with this differentiated product than any other U.S. airline. The average fare for premium economy continues to be twice the coach fare making it the most profitable use of square footage on our wide body aircraft. We are an industry leader in this category and our customers are noticing as we were recently recognized by TripAdvisor for having the best premium economy product for the more \u2013 for North American carriers and their Travelers Choice Awards. All of this resulted in record first quarter revenue of $10.6 billion, up approximately 2% year over year. On a unit revenue basis, total revenue per available seat mile improved 0.5% percent year over year. This marks the tenth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth for American. We are pleased with our revenue performance, although we were slightly below guidance, we were on track until the middle until the middle of March and the grounding of MAX after which we saw close in softness to the balance of March due to schedule uncertainty resulting from the MAX related cancellations. Also as a reminder in 2018 we made a big investment on our advantage program, making it more valuable to customers. We significantly increased the inventory available for redemptions in 2018, increasing the value of the mile to our customers, while also giving our customers more flexibility to use their miles. For the quarter these changes had a negative impact of 0.9 points to unit revenue. We anticipate a similar impact for the remainder of the year. Normalizing for this, our passenger unit revenue would have increased 1.5% in the quarter, a solid result considering the impact of the MAX grounding and our exposure to weak long haul Latin markets. We led the industry in year over year performance in both the Atlantic and Pacific entities, as we were able to grow load factor in a weak pricing environment. The Pacific also benefited from our network restructuring to China and our partnership with Japan Airlines. Japan unit revenue grew by double-digits. Our normalizing unit revenue for the domestic business grew by 1.2% in spite of the MAX routing. Latin performance was weak for American in the first quarter due to Argentina and Venezuela unit revenues which were down by over 20% and also difficult year over year comps. We expect the Latin entity to move to positive territory in the second quarter. Looking forward, we expect our second quarter year over year TRASM to be up 1% to 3%, a 1.5 point sequential improvement from the first quarter. This incorporates a negative 0.5% impact due to the MAX grounding and a negative to unit revenue because the MAX cancellations are higher yielding, lower stage likes flights from an overall system perspective and we are re-accommodating passengers into seats that would have otherwise sold at higher fare levels. So as we prepare for the busy summer season, we are all excited about what the future holds for American Airlines. We are intensely focused on creating value for our shareholders by running a great operation and continuing to improve our product and taking advantage of the opportunities to strengthen our network. With that, we'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin our question-and-answer session. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Vernon of Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the guide down on fuel and how you're thinking about the revenue environment as we get through the year. Obviously you can't give us guidance on what TRASM should be doing, but I wanted to make sure there isn't something that's following on from the disruptions caused by MAX that might make it harder for you to go ahead and exercise a little bit more pricing in a market where there's less capacity and higher fuel cost?\nDoug Parker: Okay, sure, David. This is Doug and let me first take the guidance point and then Don can talk more about the environment. So anway, the guidance change was simply again you know, oil prices are - just the change in oil prices versus three months ago $650 million [indiscernible] We didn't build into our guidance some hope that because oil prices are higher than they were three months ago that fares in the future are going to be higher than they are today. That may be the case we shall see, but we didn't do that. In this case the other three months higher \u2013 the $650 million are higher they were three months ago, but they're not much higher or much different than they were a year ago or certainly you know throughout the 2013. So they went down for a period of time. At the time we gave our last guidance, they've recovered. That doesn't \u2013 while we'll do everything we can of course to make sure we're pricing to cover our cost and increase cost as to the guidance itself largely just as the fuel price being adjusted back to current levels where they were three months ago. Don, do you want to talk about the environment.\nDon Casey: Sure. So just you know, we did see during the first quarter you know a bit of weakness in leisure yields. This was driven primarily by price reductions and flow and connecting markets in the domestic business, plus some sporadic aggressive pricing in trans cut [ph] markets. The biggest impact however was just the grounding of the MAX through the end of March and through April. As we look forward from where we\u2019re right now load factors are up in future months and the yield environment has stabilized and we're seeing growth every week and the yields are pretty happy with what the outlook looks like, which is one of the reasons why we've guided up about 0.5 in the first quarter.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then maybe just as a quick follow up to that, I think you know some of the other \u2013 the airlines that have reported have said, had actually called out a little bit more sequential improvement in things like corporate bookings. Can you comment a little bit on how the closing bookings look current for America?\nDon Casey: Sure. So again as we went through the quarter, we actually stress through January and February, a very, very strong closing yields for bookings within 13 days of departure, with the MAX cancellations we did see some share shift. This was caused by the fact that we re-accommodated customers on two flights and just less seats out in the market to go sell. That is an impact to the end of March and really through April as well. And we saw just because of schedule uncertainty as we canceled the schedule in three tranches some customers moving away just due to schedule uncertainty, that is now kind of come back and we're seeing the same kind of kind of close in yield improvements that we saw in January and February.\nDavid Vernon: Great. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJamie Baker: Hey. Good morning, everybody. The August 19th MAX date would seem to imply that recertification would need to occur sometime in July. I mean, I suppose you can operate the aircraft as spares once you have the green light, but obviously you need several weeks to sell the inventory. So you know that that July timing seems to be at odds with a growing consensus that a global regulatory consensus may be needed. And of course, rolling cancellations such as this diminish shield production. So why wouldn't the better, more profitable strategy be removing the MAXs until the holidays, adjusting labor lines accordingly and reaping the RASM benefits associated with that reduced capacity?\nDon Casey: Okay, Jamie. Let me try first the premise. And then if you'd like to explain why- if we did what you're suggesting, I think that would not be - that that would actually hurt earnings not help them.\nJamie Baker: By all means?\nDon Casey: Yes. So on the premise itself that you know, when these aircraft come back into service. You know, as Robert said, we - after you know getting every piece of information we can from the FAA and Boeing who have been working closely with us of course, you know we came to the conclusion that we needed to - we needed for our customers certainty in booking and for our team members to put the start up date as far out in the future as we thought - as we as we said to FAA and Boeing that we need like 95% certainty, that the aircraft \u2013 that what we're \u2013 that what we're going to be - what we're going to be selling will actually be flown. That's what we think about August 19th. There are all sorts of different suggestions as to what is required to do this. But the reality is the FAA and the DOT regulate the US carriers. They are working closely with Boeing. Everything we see at this point is there - is a fix that makes the aircraft airworthy for any airline. And when that - when they make that determination we expect with the aircraft will be recertified. And again, we believe August 19th is a date that gives us a lot of certainty, it gives our customer certainty and expect actually that it'll be certified well before that date. So that's why we said it there because we think it's well outside the day. So anyway, actually that's where we are\u2026\nJamie Baker: Okay\u2026\nDon Casey: You know, doing something different and that is why we did it, that's because we believe that the aircraft will be certified before that. And I certainly hope that's the case.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Second, and this may be a little bit tougher. Can you give us a feel for how many new hires you've made in pricing and revenue management over the past 970 days, not entry level, but any mid to high level type hiring\u2019s?\nDon Casey: Well, maybe you can tell us why you'd like to know that. I'm just confused what you're trying to get at Jamie.\nJamie Baker: I believe that your marketing department received a blow roughly 970 days ago with Scott's departure.\nDon Casey: Okay, thanks. Doug?\nDoug Parker: There really hasn't been anybody and so mid market and mid-level and up in the organization is are all people that we\u2019re here when Scott was here.\nDon Casey: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Darryl Genovesi of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Hey Derek, can you just help provide some sensitivity around, some earnings sensitivity around potentially longer 737 MAX drowning. I mean, I guess I'm looking for something like you know if we lose it for an extra month then the EPS it is x? Can you - are you able to do that?\nDerek Kerr: It'll be harder to do. But I mean, I can give you what the EPS impact. I mean, we said it's $0.60 for where we're at. By month or by quarter, right now in the second quarter we said over $350 million dollar impact. We have 50 in the first quarter approximately 185 in the second quarter and approximately 115 in the third quarter. So I would say you know 185 in the second quarter is a full quarter. So that's a number that's there the whole time. But that is the summer and that's the peak. So it might be a little bit higher than if it continued into August, September, October it might have a little bit less effect where we probably have a little bit more room. I mean, the reason we took it down to August 19th is that's when the end of the summer is and when the peak is. So we may have a little bit more room in August and September you know. to o cover some of the flying. So I think that that's the best we can do right now from that effect. But you got $0.60 a share and then the impact about 180 and a full quarter.\nDarryl Genovesi: Well, that's good. That's helpful. Thank you. And then and then Robert or Don, just looking at booking trends that you've seen since the MAX - since the MAX was initially or maybe even going back to before the MAXs was grounded, but when some of these headlines started coming up, have you seen anything in booking trends that would suggest a reluctance on the part of your customer base to take 737 NG flights. I mean I guess I'm just thinking that to the infrequent traveller, a 737- 800 and a 737-8, sound like more or less exactly the same thing. So just wondering if you've seen anything like that yet and if that's something that we shouldn't worry about you know, even post the return to service by the MAX>\nRobert Isom: The answer is no, there's not a significant change in load factors you know from what we can see. I think the bigger issue has been schedule uncertainty. You know, don't forget that to get to where we are now we had to go through a series of tranches of cancellations that were all close in. And as Don mentioned earlier you know, we had - in for closing bookings you know, we saw share shift that definitely benefited some of our competition. You know, the good news is, is that now we've canceled you know further out that that certainty is back and it really gives us something that we can go out with, our sales and distribution teams to give confidence that that schedule is certain. But in regard to questions about a preference for aircraft types, we don't - we haven't seen anything like that.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. Thanks for the update, appreciate it.\nRobert Isom: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Hunter Keay, Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nHunter Keay: Hey. Morning, Doug. Thank you everybody. Hey you guys have talked about over actually your over $3 billion in merger related costs being pulled out of CASM now five years after the merger. You're not the only airline to do that and so sorry to isolate you here. But I'm curious to know when these are going to stop and how much of the special items, you know, this quarter and that $3 billion have been cash? Thanks.\nDoug Parker: Thanks I'll try and give you details. Look, really good question one that we ask ourselves all the time and our auditors ask us. But the reality is what we \u2013 we\u2019re very careful about what we include in special items, they are meant to be items that are non-recurring items. Therefore to give all of us and our investors in particular an idea of what the ongoing financial performance of the company is. So and the fact of the matter is in an airline merger related activities still go on four and five years later and they still are. So we work through with our auditors to figure out what exactly things that are that are going on that are related to the merger. We still have issues related to mergers its something we \u2013 just this quarter. We got our flight attendants onto one scheduling system, so that they can - so they can work together, there is a lot more to do in maintenance and other items. So they are items that we wouldn't do if it weren't for the merger that wouldn't have been in either companies, you know if they were separate, they're there because we merged two airlines and have to incur expenses as a result of the merger. But Derek, any one detail\u2026\nDerek Kerr: Well, I would say its exactly right. I think from a cash standpoint the merger and integration items are okay. Items that come out of cash, whereas I think the fleet restructuring is non-cash and it's just bringing falling forward, catch up depreciation and accelerated depreciation. Example is you know, the aircraft that you know as part of the merger we're doing are - we call it the Oasis project or the project to conform the aircraft and make sure that they're all the seats are the same on both A321s and 73s that makes us go on the newer 737 aircraft and retire like the seats in the videos on the back five years earlier and that's catch up depreciation that you put in there. So that's non-cash, merger and integration is almost all cash. As you break out the two numbers.\nHunter Keay: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then you know, Robert or whoever maybe, you talked about Dallas growth and obviously reference to the economic strength in the region, but capacity in the DFW area is going to be about 50% higher this summer than it was in 2010. How are you thinking about that in terms of maybe you know, over saturating the market, competing against yourself either of your local or connecting basis and just managing the risk around some of this growth? Thanks.\nDon Casey: Anyway, I don't think we're actually up 50%, I am not sure.\nHunter Keay: Not you. No, no, Don, not you. It\u2019s the DFW area between you and Love Field, to be clear. Sorry.\nDon Casey: Yeah, even looking at us on Love Field, I'm not sure how you get to 50%, you know, number. I mean the big part of the growth and Love Field is capped, right. So there's really no departure growth happening at Love Field right now. We're growing about 100 departures right at DFW from 800 to 900. But anyway\u2026\nHunter Keay: Don, I'm sorry. I was talking about - just to be clear, from 2010 it's a long time ago, not year on year.\nDon Casey: It's arguably a cherry picked trough, but the point there is lot more capacity on it was 10 years ago and I'm just trying to make sure you know, how you guys are thinking about the competitive impact, either from yourselves or others? That\u2019s what I'm getting at? Thanks.\nHunter Keay: Sure. Well, as we get from 2010 to 2018 right which was up until last year, it's been one of our best performing hubs during that entire time period, right. We're growing at this year a big percentage of the customers we're going to grow we're going to be connecting customers, right, so not really reliant, just on the DFW market. And again when we look at the early results in terms of the how the new markets are booking up, their booking at or above the system average, so I think we're pretty encouraged.\nDerek Kerr: Yeah. And we\u2019re looking at all Jim is \u2013 I am sorry, I do it every time. And it's not intentional, I promised.\nDoug Parker: Jamie and I were just discussing that earlier this morning ironically, but you continue.\nDerek Kerr: I know, sincere apologies to you both. So look, again I mean, this is one of these once in a lifetime opportunities that are good for the airline in everyway, it is you know, our largest of the chance to expand it by 100 departures, it doesn't come along very often. Frankly it's not so much about Dallas, as it is about the United States because we connect \u2013 we will be connecting most of those people over Dallas much more to markets that we weren't able to sell before. In some cases that our competitors are able so in other cases that we just sold you know not very efficiently. So it's you know, these things as Robert noted we add these flights, they come in at system average, they don't need to build up their markets that - there's demand for the travel and you fly an airplane into Dallas, Fort Worth and it connects people to hundreds of markets. They didn't have opportunities to fly to before. It's built not the hub getting it even to be even more powerful than it is today. And it's really, it's very nice growth.\nDoug Parker: I\u2019ll just add that you know these 15 Gates in this satellite-e, that's a fantastic opportunity. So you know versus you know going out and spending tens of millions dollars you know for Gate you know anywhere else you know for growth. These are these are a fraction of a fraction of that kind of cost and we're ready to go. So excited.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thank you very much.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Hunter.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Jose Caiado of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJose Caiado: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the time. I was hoping we could start just with the cost of the MAX grounding, which you quantified at $350 million for the year. I guess, I'm struggling to reconcile that with what we heard yesterday from your crosstown competitor which has larger fleet exposure than you do, but appears to be guiding to a lesser MAX impact for the full year. Could you maybe walk us through why that might be and the moving pieces there, is that maybe a function of where you concentrated at your MAX fleet just any help there?\nDoug Parker: Okay. First, anyway. I look at that number, their absolute numbers that they gave one, and if they did it's dramatically different.\nDon Casey: I mean, the only thing we could figure out from their guidance was they went \u2013 CASM was worst by 4% and RASM went up by 1%. So a four point basis point reduction in earnings which would be over on their margin would be over $250 million dollars in the second quarter. So\u2026\nDoug Parker: But we shouldn't speak for that But our analysis at least on what they said looked consistent with ours is what we should say, we may be missing that, but what we just looked at what they said came in those numbers as Derek said that way. So it seem totally consistent. In terms of the absolute number, the inconsistency versus ours is a little bit as Robert suggested that our RASM in the second quarter would be lower than it would've been otherwise, this suggest to be would be higher, and they have higher CASM and we didn't have until we got that much. You know, again this is not speaking for them only for us, but trying ourselves to understand why that may be, that is that we see more of a revenue per ASM change and \u2013 we see revenue per ASM falling actually, they see it going up a little bit. And in the second quarter a few points to make, one in this December MAX of course is an entirely domestic airplane. So on the American Airlines system, well the domestic revenue per ASM is a higher number than revenue per ASM internationally because of stage link. So Southwest probably doesn\u2019t have the issue. They don't - they're not taking out their highest revenue per ASM flying, in this case we are just a math issue basically. But that would have an impact. The other point you know that I that I imagine is the case. Robert talked about how painful this is to us. At American in the near term when we have people who have bought travel in advance, so you know in our pricing model, Some leisure travelers with advanced purchases who have bought lower priced tickets. And then we cancel them in a relatively near term. In a peak, we need to provide them seats that we were holding back for higher price customers, for higher yielding customers. So that has a real impact on revenue per ASM. And again, Southwest pricing model has less of that than ours. So those again is our best guess as to why they may be seeing a different thing on revenue per ASM than we are. But the total - the total profitability impact to us look right in line with where we are, but if we're wrong on that, let us not\u2026\nJose Caiado: Yeah, I know that\u2019s\u2026\nDoug Parker: What are you talking for certain is we feel really confident in our number, we spent a lot of time on it and we feel really good about our estimate. Yeah, that's totally fair. Thank you for that Doug. I know it's not clean math, but that's helpful. Just switching gears, Robert or Don maybe, I was hoping you could give us an update on where you are with those IT initiatives or that that infrastructure work that you were doing that was going to enhance your ability to kind of push out more offers and drive more ancillary conversions. Is that project completed and contributing already?\nRobert Isom: No, Don, you can \u2013 and Mike can add in here to, we're on track to be able to really put some nice offers out that to customers that you know post purchase but pre-flight at the end of this month.\nDoug Parker: That's right our first product its an upscale subsidiary push offers at upselling a premium cabin and we're going to be in market with our initial product by the end of May.\nJose Caiado: That's great. Thanks for the time everyone.\nDoug Parker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Dan Mckenzie of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.\nDan Mckenzie: Hey good morning. Thanks, guys. First question is really just sort of a clarifying question regarding the full year guide you know the narrative in the first quarter was off peak pricing weakness because there's too much capacity and as I just kind of look at the growth that you guys are laying out for the fourth quarter it's up 6% and you know not asking you guys to give a revenue forecast for the fourth quarter, but just hoping you can clarify whether the kind of revised guide does factor in some off peak pricing weakness that you know it's probably likely to manifest in the fourth quarter or are what gives you comfort that the fourth quarter won't be a repeat of the first quarter?\nDoug Parker: Its Doug. When we talk about growth for this year it is DFW and then the start of Charlotte. So you know again as we take a look at you know any of the growth that is done it mentioned earlier any growth we have planned for the summer as we extend out into that schedule for DFW and Charlotte. You know we think that that is a smart growth and it's growth that is going to maintain performance for us we take a look out through the end of the year.\nDan Mckenzie: Okay. I just try to clear this, the fourth quarter factor in potentially some pricing weakness or you know there's a fact I mean maybe you can just help because that Hunter's question, actually was my question as well, maybe you can just help us understand the nature of the growth you know what percent of the growth is smaller high yielding markets, you know what percent is kind of a larger competitive markets that may be lost on folks, just as we kind of think about the revenue trajectory through the end of the year?\nDoug Parker: Again the bulk of the growth is going to be focused on Dallas right, skewed to overall domestic growth. Domestic has again higher nominal, right. So the entity mix as we head into the fourth quarter is going to be favorable for us.\nDan Mckenzie: Smaller markets though I mean like 50% of the growth out of Dallas is to smaller higher yielding markets. So can you just help give us a little bit more clarity there?\nDoug Parker: 50% regional. So that that would be the case.\nDan Mckenzie: Understood. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Susan Donofrio of Macquarie Capital. Your line is now up.\nSusan Donofrio: Yes, good morning. I just wanted to get some more color on your international markets in terms of the trends you're seeing. If you could also just provide a little more color on competition in those markets?\nDon Casey: Okay, sure. This is Don. I mean, if you go to look at the first quarter you know Latin was our most challenged entity for the quarter. You know particular for Argentina and Venezuela where we saw you know revenue declines as you know more than 20%. Just as a reminder we did end up suspending operations to Venezuela on March 28. So that won't have an impact as we look forward. We also in the first quarter - particularly difficult comps in Latin America in our unit revenue growth in the first quarter last year is up 12%, while the rest of the industry grew in the 5% range. We also face some currency headwinds in the first quarter. Latin America by about 1.7 points. But as we look forward into the second quarter in Latin America we expect Latin America actually positive in the second quarter and we expect Brazil to have positive revenue in the second quarter as well. In Atlantic, we did see softer pricing in the economy cabin during the first quarter which we're able to offset with higher load factors. Premium demand did hold up and we were able to improve our yields in the premium cabins. UK was our top performing market in the first quarter and we have not really seen any impact at this point related to Brexit. And we expect similar to potentially slightly better performance in Atlantic as we look into the second quarter. Pacific was our best performing entity for the quarter with unit revenue growth about 9%. Gains were really in both yield and load factor across the both economy and business gap. And so it is really broad strength in the Pacific. I mean every entity in the Pacific I posit you know revenue growth led by Hong Kong, Japan. We benefited from our restructuring of our operations to China and our partnership with China Southern. So we added five additional Kocher cities to Beijing, and now to Shanghai we now cover either through our own metal or through our coach. With China Southern 86% of demand. So we expect that Pacific looking forward to be solidly profitable in the second quarter - solidly positive in the second quarter as well.\nSusan Donofrio: Great. And then just as a follow up on, is there anything you're doing in terms of further integration of your alliance partners?\nDon Casey: I guess, that's just an ongoing process right. So with all of our joint businesses you know, we have a roadmap of initiatives on how we're going to better integrate our services because that's really the key is creating more seamless experience for customers across the combined networks.\nDoug Parker: And there's good news on the horizon, that we're very confident that our Qantas JV. will be approved to go forward sometime soon and that's beneficial. And we're constantly at work with IAG, especially B.A. and making sure that you know every thing that we do is making our product more consistent and easier to use for our customers.\nSusan Donofrio: Great. Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Susan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just one question Doug, as you outlined in your release free cash flow should increase significantly heading into 2020 and really kind of be a first year of true free cash flow generation since the merger. I know this has been the story given your CapEx program and other cash hasn't come in the door for a bit, but can you maybe just give us a sense of what your priorities are going be for that free cash flow as you stand right now? Thanks.\nDoug Parker: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. They'll be consistent, what you've seen from us to date and then looking at - and our view on capital allocation goes like this, as we generate cash we use it first, again having generating cash having - having invested in the operation, but having produced revenues in excess of what we've spent in the operation. We then look to invest in the business in any manner that can get returns for our investors, that meet our thresholds. Those obviously as we as we get through all of this both merger - capital expense and fleet monetization expense fall off. So we'll have - we have less need for CapEx is what we're saying. We then look to with the cash flow then it still exists. Free cash flow that comes we look to make sure that all of our debt is efficient and not at the level that is remotely concerning. So there's any debt that can be - it is that high levels can be preplanning debt that's coming due that is amortizing we pay off and may or may not decide to refinance issue, refinance based upon where we're at the time. Having done all that what we want to be certain is at least in today's environment that we have at least $7 billion of liquidity at any time, that's an enormous amount of cash for a company our size. But that is the cost to our shareholders and it being more levered. What we know is as confident we are in the future we need to be prepared for any short of any sort of black swan type event that could require us to need additional capital, so we hold a lot of cash with a view that's more important in those times than having unencumbered airplanes which are hard to finance in those times. So having done all that to the extent there's a free cash flow that goes for our shareholders because we've determined that there's - we've used what we've generate to as best - as best we can. And having no other alternatives we look to give it back to our shareholders. If we believe the stock is undervalued, the best way to do that is buyback our shares. If we happen to believe the stock is fairly valued, we would look to do things like dividends. o that's what you should expect.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you for that.\\\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Doug, kind of along those lines, you've got the free cash flow outlook over the next few years, you know what your stock is trading at now. Is there any thought to kind of pulling some of that forward. You've talked about eventually lowering the $7 billion to something like 5. What are your thoughts there at this point? Thanks.\nDoug Parker: Yeah, look I don't believe either 77, do we're going to lower in 75. So I want to correct that. What I have said I think is $7 billion is a really high number for a company our size. I'm always careful to note that because some people started talking about that as some sort of a minimum cash is not even closer to a maximum cash. Basically you could run this airline up to probably $2 billion of cash before you started being \u2013 before you started having sort of issues about the future. But - so we hold basically a $5 billion cushion, I think I said, and maybe that at some point I think it'll be - it'll make sense to relook that number. But you know., where we today we still believe that's the right number we still do have, we still are working through merger, we still do have some large CapEx expenditures in this year and we still and frankly we still and we - this earnings level that we're projecting isn\u2019t what we believe is an earnings level that gets us excited about reducing that number either. So for all those reasons we think $7 billion is the right number at this point in time. And as aggressive as we are in terms of wanting to return capital to shareholders certainly and aggressive at these valuations and wanting to repurchase shares. We are equally if not where we are more aggressive in our view that we're not going to - we're not going to violate the $7 billion cash number. As we move forward, we think that's important that we keep in place that - as we sit here today. As we move forward, I suspect we'll come to the conclusion that we don't need to have that large of a number. But we're still working through all the issues I said and as we do so that feel like the right number now.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then just on the 357, I mean, I know the proxy will come out shortly. Can you talk about whether the bonus pool got funded in 2018 that you fell short on a pre-tax income basis of the three? And then how you're thinking about that going forward and any changes you're thinking about on the 357? Thank you.\nDoug Parker: Yeah. Happy to. I think in the 357 everyone else doesn't know we're talking about \u2013 we have and have had for a while our incentive - our short term incentive plan tied to pre-tax profits with a threshold $3 billion, target of $5 billion maximum of $7 billion which is which as we've stated is our long term view about the profitability generating potential of this company. In 2018, you're right on a reported basis we were slightly below %3 billion on a pre-tax level but this calculation is made prior to the payments themselves of course and prior to profit sharing. So what you'll see in the proxy is that while it was reported number below $3 billion in terms of the plan calculation it was slightly above $3 billion. So the team got a 51% of their target bonus in 2018. As we move to 2019 and setting the plan you know, we - as to the named executive officers me and my director reports are still are still on in 2018 the 357 plan. But look we got to be careful about making sure that while we may believe that's the long term future, we're going to make certain that we have incentive plans that allow our team to believe they have a reasonable chance at getting their bonuses in any given year. So we did amend the plan for everyone below the any of us to \u2013 for ought to be split into two components now of financial - financial plan and the operational plan 50/50 of each and the financial piece we tied for 2018, for 2019 I am sorry, to $4 billion of pre-tax earnings and starting at zero, much like the profit sharing does. So that - that's where we set it going forward. Long way we say, which I think you really care about more is what is our view about 357 over the long term, its still - again we said there, I still believe this company has potential. I will tell you as we sit here today you know, given where we were for the past couple of years, as you think about explaining to people where you think you are. I would say certainly as you go into 2019 that it feels a lot more like 3, 4, 5, 4 is a good year, 5 would be a great year, 3 is not a very good year. That's - and I am not trying to make any big statement there about our long term view of the company, but just rather let you know what it feels like today and really what I'm saying it's tightened somewhat in that range. And you know, and we'll see where it goes going forward. But you know, what I would also point out is if you want to go build the numbers like that in the models into the future you're going to find I believe you will find that our stock is well undervalued because it's not trading like - it's certainly not trading at 3, 5, 7, it is not trading like 3, 4,5. And that's where we believe we are today.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Parker: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. I just had two quick follow up question, just on the summer operations in Dallas, I recognize that you're getting additional gate, so it's not like you're working more gates. But just given the extra flying are you comfortable with the kind of the air side capacity and you know - that we're not going to see something like we saw in LAX a couple of years ago?\nDoug Parker: Yeah, great news on that, as we've had teams that hard at work for you know literally you know over a year to make sure not only the facility is ready to go, but surface management at the airport and then also you know ATC is ready to go. And so when we take a look at from a regional perspective or from a mainline perspective and whether you're talking about you know Gates or equipment or personnel, we've already ramped up to a considerable level, we're not quite at the 900 level yet, but we will be at the end of this month and really confident about where we go - where we are going forward.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow up on the capacity, you mentioned that you'll take a look at forward capacity, it's going to fuel states higher as you get into the shoulder periods again. Is there is that more of the kind of domestic perspective or should we think international and domestic or how should we think about kind of - where the potential cuts could come?\nDoug Parker: Well, we haven't thinking about cuts, what I would say is that we're all - we're always on the lookout to make sure that we're optimizing profitability for the network as a whole. And so you know both you know international, domestic are interrelated and you know it's a network business. So as we take a look we will evaluate, you know our hubs, we\u2019ll evaluate our fleet and certainly you know, all the cities that we fly. But as you know - I'll underscore again you know when we talk about the DFW flying for the remainder of the year and the growth that we have planned for the year it's largely DFW related and the kind of things that we're doing, is we're adding some new markets, some new spokes to DFW places like Cheyenne, and Del Rio and Harlingen you know, places that we haven\u2019t served and then you know increasing capacity from a perspective of frequency out of DFW just some markets both you know, the smaller and midsized that we think that's going to make DFW stronger overall for the long run.\nDoug Parker: Appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be taking questions from members of the media. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tracy Rucinski of Reuters. Your line is now open.\nTracy Rucinski: Hi. Good morning Doug, you seem very confident about the MAX being ungrounded by August 19th. But there is still some uncertainty from global regulators. So my question is, if the FAA a recertifies the MAX, that other regions or countries like Europe or Canada have issue will you still fly it?\nDoug Parker: If the FAA recertifies the MAX, we absolutely will fly the airplane. That's our regulator. And if the FAA determines that it's airworthy, it is absolutely airworthy and anyone that\u2019s flying on an aircraft will know that for certain. Look, but, this is part of the issue that you know FAA and DOT need to work through, the administration needs to work through. And I don't know that that's a scenario that will develop or not. But to be clear, we're regulated by the FAA. We know that that aircraft with our pilots with our training systems, with our aircraft is airworthy, will be certainly will be airworthy if the FAA recertifies it and we will \u2013 so yes.\nTracy Rucinski: Okay. And if pilots ask for added level of simulator training on checklists related to MCAS failures, like runway stabilizer, will you provide it? And is there any possibility that additional training demands either from pilot unions or global regulator could delay the return to service of the aircraft?\nDoug Parker: Well, look again, our pilots were critical of this, we've been working. Our pilots have been heavily involved in all this work. We -that's what gives us - what will give us confidence and what will give the flying public confidence that the aircraft is safe to fly will be when American Airlines pilots say that it's safe to fly because I can tell you for certain is that if an American owned pilot decides that their plane is safe to fly you can be a hundred percent certain of that and not because - not out of bravado, out of analysis, out of understanding the aircraft, out of training, out of knowing, they have been their co-pilot has been trained accordingly. So absolutely our pilots will be not just involved and critical to this process will make sure whatever time the aircraft is deemed airworthy that our pilots will - that will have a leadership role in ensuring that they are comfortable with that. So that's given and we'll make sure that will be done. But again we believe based on what we know now that that was by August 19th, we will pass those thresholds.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal. Your line is now open.\nAlison Sider: Hi. Thanks so much. Good morning. You know, since the two crashes there's just been a lot of discussion about pilot training, standards around the world. Just wondering if you have looked at some of your partner airlines if you're having any concerns or questions about training at partners and if that's something you have conversations with them about?\nDoug Parker: So that the good news is that you know we work very closely with all of our partner carriers and it is a process when we establish relationships, you know we do extensive reviews of their operations as well. And so you know from our perspective you know we feel very comfortable with the one more carriers that we deal with and as well with you know our joint business partners and we'll continue to make sure that you know customers flying an American Airlines whether on American Airlines or with any of our partners that they're getting the best service and the most safe and reliable service that you can get.\nAlison Sider: And are those things - are those ongoing conversations you know, have there been any sort of like renewed looks at that standards or procedures that other airlines or is that something that sort of happened you know at the outset on a partnership...\nDoug Parker: It's a constant process.\nAlison Sider: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Patti Waldmeir of Financial Times. Your line is now open.\nPatti Waldmeir: Thanks so much. Can you say anything about what compensation you may be seeking from Boeing for the costs that you've referred to on this call, the cost of the grounding and you know even things like you know staff working overtime to rebook passengers things like that?\nDoug Parker: Yeah, all of our efforts at this point are working to make sure you get the airplane recertified and flying again for our customers and our team members were working closely with Boeing, at the appropriate time we'll talk about what this is done to American. And Boeing's is a very good and long time partner and we'll work through that privately, but nothing that we \u2013 we had any conversations at that point yet. And at some point perhaps we will, but right now we're focused on working together to get the airplane back andrecertify.\nPatti Waldmeir: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Biers of AFP. Your line is now open.\nJohn Biers: Thank you. Just most of my questions have been answered already, but I wondered are you - how does this whole situation with the 737 MAX affect the way you think about Boeing versus Airbus going forward?\nDoug Parker: Boeing, is a phenomenal company that builds great airplanes as is Airbus. Obviously we're not happy about this issue but no one is. Tragic events and what we care about is safety and we will work together as this industry always does to ensure that safety is the number one focus. And we don't compete on safety nor do aircraft manufacturers. So we will as an industry make certain that that this is addressed in a way that ensures that all aircraft are 100% safe and as that happens we're certain that both manufacturers are committed to that as we are.\nJohn Biers: Did you feel like you have a clear understanding of what went wrong with the aircraft, in the crashes at this point?\nDoug Parker: I'll just I'll just chime in here. Look we have to - first off you know we operated the 737 MAX you know very successfully for a number of months and really hadn't had to deal with any anomalies. So what we're doing is working with the FAA and with Boeing on what's been reported you know from the incidents to make the aircraft better and correct any deficiencies. And I know that when we get through with addressing the issues related to MKS software that it's going to be an even better plane. And so, again from our perspective we have what you know about you know issues related to the aircraft. We certainly have our own experience with it and we're constantly working to make sure that we make the aircraft better and you know we look forward to recertification.\nJohn Biers: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Ted Reed of Forbes. Your line is now open.\nTed Reed: Thank you. I have two questions. First, I'd like to know about Munich. I don't understand the reasoning behind canceling Philadelphia and then starting Munich, Charlotte and Munich Dallas?\nDoug Parker: Hey, Ted. We're constantly taking a look at how the marketplace works and for us it's just better connecting opportunities. And so we think that it's going to be a great fight and hopefully it'll lead to better things in the future.\nTed Reed: Looking strong from the two new destiny from the two new hub, from these two hubs?\nDoug Parker: Yes it is. And you know for smaller markets you just need a lot more connecting traffic to make, in survey\u2026\nTed Reed: Secondly, I thought the pilot talks were going to go rapidly but now it seems that they're going slowly and that there might not be any kind of deal till next year? Is that the case.\nDoug Parker: We've just begun negotiation with our pilots. The talks are happening well in advance of the amendable date which is January of 2020. So we're happy to be talking well in advance of that. And we would be - it would be nice to get something done before the amenable date. I think both parties goals and we'll keep working toward that, nothing new to report.\nTed Reed: All right. Thank you, Doug.\nDoug Parker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Doug Parker for closing remarks.\nDoug Parker: My closing remarks is thank you. Thank you for your interest. If you have any questions give Dan or corporate communications a call. Thanks, again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."}, {"symbol": "AAL", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-01-24 17:01:14", "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentleman. And welcome to the Fourth Quarter American Airlines Group earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference maybe recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Cravens, Managing Director Investor Relations. Sir you may begin.\nDan Cravens: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the American Airlines Group's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us in the room this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Finance Officer. Also in the room for our Q&A session are several of our senior exes, including Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the fourth quarter and provide some additional information on our 2019 guidance. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then, after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions, and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast or capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can also be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will be archived on the Web site, and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us. At this point, I would like to the turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nDoug Parker: Thanks, Dan. Thanks everyone. We reported fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings this morning. For 2018, we had pretax profit excluding special items of $2.8 billion for the year. 2018 was a challenging year for us financially, higher fuel prices per gallon drove an increase in our total fuel expense by $2.2 billion versus 2017, and that led to about $1.4 billion reduction in our pretax earnings. I guess we had difficult operations environment during the summer. But we entered 2019 with the great momentum and excitement. Derek and Robert will cover this in lot more detail, but we are dedicated in improving our operations liability and that work has already taken hold, and we are excited about how we will perform going throughout 2019. We have over $1 billion of revenue and cost initiatives that are well underway that we know are going to help us to improve our earnings in 2019 versus '18. We're growing where we have a competitive advantage, thanks in large part to our ability to grow our largest job in Dallas-Fort Worth. And we are nearing the end of our unprecedented post merger capital expenditure, capital requirements which Derek will talk a little more about. So we feel great about where we are positioned. Our teams are doing a great job. And we couldn't be more proud of the work they are doing to take care of our customers. And we are really looking forward to 2019. Consistent with that optimism, we provided some 2019 EPS guidance this morning that has -- Derek can talk more about it, so there's relatively wide range but the middle of that range would have our EPS up about little over 40% higher than what we announced for 2018. So with that said, I'll turn over to Derek to give you a lot more detail.\nDerek Kerr: Thanks Doug and good morning everybody. I'd like to start by recognizing our team who did a great job of taking care of our customers during the busy holiday travel period. Despite challenging weather conditions in some of our hubs, the preparation and teamwork of our operations group was evident and it made a real difference for our customers. So from all of us, I want to thank you all for all your efforts. We filed our fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 earnings press release this morning. While fuel prices fell during the quarter, our average fuel cost per gallon was 17.5% higher than the same period last year. Excluding net special items, we reported a fourth-quarter net profit of $481 million in 2018 versus 2017 fourth-quarter net profit of $444 million. For the full year, our net income, excluding net special items, was $2.1 billion, down 18% versus 17% on a 29% increase in average fuel price. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding net special items in the fourth quarter was $1.04 per share, up from $0.93 per diluted share in the fourth quarter last year. And for the full year of 2018, our earnings per diluted share excluding net special items was $4.55. Our fourth quarter pretax profit excluding net special items was $634 million with a pretax margin of 5.8%. And on a full-year basis also excluding net special items, we earned pretax income of $2.8 billion on a pretax margin of 6.3%. The fourth quarter of 2018 was American Airlines' ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year total operating revenue growth, which was up 3.1% to $10.9 billion. This represents the highest fourth quarter total operating revenue in American Airlines' history. For the full year, total operating revenues were also a record, up 4.5% to $44.5 billion. On a unit revenue basis, total RASM was up 1.7% for the fourth quarter and up 2.4% for the year. This growth was driven by the continued enhancements of our revenue management system, as well as the positive impact of our basic and premium economy products, which help drive 2.9% improvement in passenger revenues for the fourth quarter to $10 billion. For the year, total passenger revenue was up 3.9% to $40.7 billion. Our cargo team finished the year with an excellent fourth quarter, increasing revenues by 3% or $264 million. This growth was due primarily to higher cargo yields. And for the first time ever, our cargo revenue exceeded $1 billion for the full year. So congratulations to the cargo team. They worked hard to reach this milestone and we look forward to growing this segment of our business in 2019 and beyond. We\u2019ve seen strength in our loyalty program all year and that trend continued in the fourth quarter, driving other revenues higher by 6.3% to $712 million for the quarter. Full year 2018 other revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 9.7%. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $10.4 billion, up 4.2% due primarily to 19.6% increase in consolidated fuel expense. For the full year 2018, fuel costs were up nearly 32% or $2.4 billion, which drove 9.1% increase in total annual operating expenses. When fuel and special items are excluded, our unit costs decreased in the fourth quarter by 0.2% compared to 2017. This was due in part to the success of our one-airline cost initiatives. This project gained momentum during the year and as a result, our full year 2018 CASM, excluding fuel and special items, was up only 1.4% as compared to the projected increase of 2% that was guided to at the beginning of the year. It's worth noting that we were able to beat our unit cost projections despite lowering our capacity growth by more than 50 basis points from our initial expectations at the beginning of the year. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.6 billion in total available liquidity. During the quarter, our treasury team completed several transactions, including upsizing and expanding our existing $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion, while improving the undrawn economics. We have committed financing for all mainline aircraft deliveries through June 2019, and continue to evaluate financing options for our remaining mainline and regional aircraft deliveries in 2019. In 2018, we made contributions of $467 million to our defined benefit pension plans. For 2019, we now intend to make contributions of $800 million, up slightly from the $780 million that we projected in our last earnings call. Rising interest rates have helped our pension liability and brought it down by $1.4 billion. However, the sell-off in risk assets in the fourth quarter resulted in negative asset return for the year, driving the increased contribution in order to maintain our desired funding status for all of our plans. During 2018, we lowered our adjusted debt including pensions by approximately $760 million. We anticipate our 2019 year-end adjusted debt will be lower by more than $1 billion compared to year end 2018. Over the next few years this trend is planned to continue as we pay down our existing obligations, and our new aircraft deliveries slowed significantly after 2019. During the quarter, we did adapt early the new lease accounting standard, which requires leases to be recognized on the balance sheet as liabilities with corresponding right of use assets. That early adoption of this standard benefited pretax income excluding net special items in the fourth quarter by $54 million. Of which a significant portion relates to prior quarters in 2018. We will recast 2018 quarters for the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in our 2018 10-K filing. We did not purchase any stock during the quarter of 2018, leaving our available authorization for stock buybacks unchanged at $1.65 billion. We continue to believe our stock is undervalued. Unfortunately, the fall of oil prices, which improved our liquidity outlook at the end of the year occurred during a close trading window. And as a result, we were unable to resume stock repurchases during the fourth quarter despite ending the quarter at $600 million above our threshold. However, our plan is still to return excess cash above our $7 billion liquidity threshold to our shareholders as we have done in the past. We filed our Investor Relations update this morning, which includes our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2019. We anticipate our capacity will grow approximately 3% during 2019 with growth of approximately 1% in the first quarter. The full year capacity growth will come primarily from incremental flying out of our new gates at DFW our most profitable hub to be worth about 2% of that growth, as well as our fleet harmonization project that is adding seats to our existing narrow body aircraft, that\u2019s about 0.5% and allows us to grow capacity in an extremely efficient way. Given the timing of these two initiatives, we expect that our capacity growth will be weighted more towards the back half of 2019. For the full year, we expect our cost per ASM excluding fuel and special items and new labor deals will grow at the top end of the 1% to 2% range that we gave previously. This is higher than previous guidance due to an increase in sale leaseback transactions on our aircraft and higher-than-expected growth in profit sharing on larger expected earnings improvement. Overall, CASM growth in 2019 is primarily driven by increased maintenance expense from required engine overhauls, increased airport rent expense at our hubs and higher earnings related salaries and expenses primarily from the increased profit sharing. Due to the ASM growth weighted in the back half of the year, our annual CASM increase will not be spread evenly throughout the year and will be front end loaded. For the first quarter, our CASM expected to be up approximately 4% year-over-year. This rate of growth is the highest of the year due to the lower ASM growth, as well as the timing of aircraft maintenance, salaries and benefits and selling expenses throughout the year. CASM growth is expected to decelerate to approximately 2.5% in the second quarter and further decline to approximately 1% in the third and 0.5% in the fourth for 2019. Fuel prices fell sharply at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 and we anticipate lower fuel expenses during 2019 based on the forward curve as of January 22nd. We are forecasting a decrease in consolidated fuel expense of 8.4% or approximately $830 million for the full year 2019 as compared to '18. We expect our average fuel price will be between $1.97 and $2.02 per gallon in the first quarter and be around $1.99 to $2.04 for the full year. We also guided to our first quarter 2019 TRASM increase of flat to up 2% and Robert will provide more details on our revenue guidance in his remarks. With this revenue and cost guidance, we expect our first quarter 2019 pretax margin excluding net special items to be between 2.5% and 4.5%. Finally, we anticipate that our earnings per diluted share excluding net special items will be between $5.50 and $7.50 in 2019 and as Doug said, an increase of approximately 40% at the midpoint over our 2018 adjusted earnings per share. This forecast includes our expectations of an incremental $1 billion in revenue improvement and $300 million in cost reductions from the one airline initiative I talked about earlier. We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 of $4.7 billion. This will include $3 billion in aircraft CapEx as we take delivery of 31 new large regional jets to replace 50 seaters along with 37 narrow body aircraft to replace our MD-80 fleet that will retire after the summer and also an additional 287 aircraft. In line with previous guidance, we continue to expect that our non-aircraft CapEx will be $1.7 billion in 2019. Total CapEx is presently expected to fall to $3.3 billion in 2020 and $2.2 billion in 2021 as our fleet renewal program winds down. So looking forward, 2019 will be exciting year for American Airlines. We\u2019re executing more than $1.3 billion of annual revenue improvement and cost revenue initiatives and when combined that with the additional of high margin growth at our most profitable hubs and planned operational improvements, we expect significant earnings growth in 2019. And with that, I will turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Isomand: Thanks, Derek and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I too would like to thank our team. 2018 was a challenging year for our company as we face rising fuel prices, difficult weather conditions, the uncertainty of trade wars and the early stages of government shutdown. Despite these challenges, our team did a fantastic job of taking care of customers and each other. These are actions most certainly made the difference and demonstrated our resiliency. We\u2019re a team that collaborates, adapts and continues to move forward. So from all of us, thank you again for a job well done. Operationally since the merger, we've been making steady progress in improving our core operating metrics but we fell short in 2018 of our targets. On our last earnings call, we highlighted some of the initiatives we are undertaking, including making the fleet ready to go each morning, making sure that we resource our team to turn aircraft throughout the day. We also continued to evaluate and fine-tune our planning processes to ensure that we are ready to deliver better service during peak schedule periods. These efforts are starting to pay off. During the December holiday period, our system-level on-time departure performance improved by 4.5 points year-over-year and our completion factor improved by 1.3 points. At the hub level, we saw double-digit improvements in on-time departures at Reagan National, New York JFK and LaGuardia and Philadelphia. We also saw 25% improvement in mainline aircraft out of service during that same period. We\u2019re encouraged with the progress we've made thus far and look forward to keeping that going in 2019. We also completed another major integration project in the fourth quarter, the integration of our 27,000 flight attendants. This is an important milestone and our largest and most complicated integration project to-date. It involves program and new work rules and managing complicated pay processes in line with those work rules. Importantly, training schedules and a multitude of other pieces have to work perfectly for this very important team. We\u2019re starting to see the benefits of our flight attendance now that they can fly on any aircraft at our fleet and they also have the flexibility to transfer to different bases. For our customers, we'll be able to recover much more quickly during regular operations as we can inter-mix crews. And for about the company and product attendants, we'll get a lot more efficient with scheduling our aircraft and team members. Switching gears from integration work to product. Throughout 2018, we made great progress improving the overall experience for our customers. We\u2019ve invested $25 billion in our team in our facilities and our product and fleet since we merged five years ago. That $25 billion represents the largest investment of any carrier in the history of commercial aviation in such a short time period. These investments are transforming our product and creating a consistent and reliable airline for this coming year and long into the future. On the product side, we've now activated free live TV on 270 aircraft and we continue to be the only U.S. carrier to offer live television on international flights. We believe our customers want faster and more consistent connectivity for work and to stream entertainment to their mobile devices. Our installations of high-speed Wi-Fi and in-seat power throughout our long-term domestic fleet are on track with 570 mainline narrow body aircraft already complete. All planned narrow bodies will be done by the middle of this year. And if you haven\u2019t experienced the ease and speed of this connectivity, you're in for a terrific experience. In addition, we launched new fresh food items from Zoe's kitchen in our main cabin, and the uptake has been extremely positive. We're also growing our network of flagship first dining and flagship lounges with DFW opening in the second quarter. Our most club network updates are also underway with facility refresh projects in Boston, Charlotte, B Concourse and Pittsburg in the first half of 2019. For network, we had a new international service in 2018 to Reykjavik, Budapest and Prague, which were all very well received by our travel agent and cruise partners. This year we'll continue to play to our network strengths with high margin growth plan for Dallas-Fort Worth and Charlotte hubs. At DFW, we're adding 15 new gates and roughly 100 departures per day. These additional departures will begin in April. And importantly, this capacity will be added into a robust and in first local economy here in Texas, which is one of the fastest growing U.S. markets, both in terms of GDP and wages. We'll also add new transatlantic service to the Tuscany region of Italy, Berlin, Germany and Dubrovnik, Croatia, out of our hub in Philadelphia. And lastly in Washington DC, construction continues on the new regional terminal in DCA. We're expecting completion of that regional terminal in 2021, sounds like a far update it will come quickly and will be ready. Our plans include up-gauging aircraft to further grow this important market. Our global sales and distribution team is executing well in their initiatives, producing overall corporate revenue growth that is outpaced to system revenue growth. We will continue to build and diversify our portfolio of small business accounts that have historic pace, and we're seeing a record number of these small business accounts graduate into entry-level corporate contracts at a rate that is nearly 10 times that of last year. In growing our small business programs, we are not only delivering strong results today but we are also establishing a foundation for growth in the long-term. In addition, we have launched both TripLink and additional international forms of payment to grow direct bookings. For our loyalty program, 2018 marked another year of revenue growth, which grew by high-single digits on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see strong year-over-year growth in advantage program enrollments and cobranded credit card acquisitions. Our 2018 improvements in the Citi Advantage platinum select MasterCard and the launch of the no fee AAdvantage MileUp card provide added value to customers and we're really seeing the revenue benefits of this expanded portfolio. Our Citi platinum and Aviator Red MasterCards remain our most popular cards and the new AAdvantage MileUp card is exceeding our expectations. And our Citi AAdvantage executive card acquisition saw growth as well, reflecting strength across range of card segments. With a record number of co-branded AAdvantage MasterCard acquisitions in 2018, we believe our dual issuer model is delivering attractive choices for our customers. We expect these strong results to continue for our program in 2019. Product segmentation has added another dimension to our business, and our strategy continues to perform very well. In 2018, we added premium economy to more than 100 aircraft out of a total of 124 planned aircraft. American has more aircrafts with premium economies than any other U.S. airline. The average fare for premium economy continues to be twice the coach fare. And when we look at the booking profile for this product, it is clear that customers are buying up from the main cabin. Installations remain on track and we expect them to be complete by this summer. Looking forward, we will further monetize premium economy with new revenue management and merchandising capabilities. Basic economy has also been expanded and we now offer this option across the entire domestic network, as well as most the Atlantic, Caribbean, Mexico and Central America. We have made a number of refinements to the program to ensure that we are competitively considered, including eliminating the carry-on bag restriction. With this change, we are now able to roll out our full range of fares to more than twice as many customers as before. Since this change, the average up-sell rate continues to be around 60%, which has exceeded our initial expectations. In addition, the sell-up amount is increased by $5 and is now approximately $26. All of this is resulted in record fourth quarter revenue of $10.9 billion, up 3% year-over-year. As Derek mentioned, we saw solid growth in other revenues, driven in part by continued strength in co-brand credit card acquisitions and cardholder spend. At our unit revenue basis, total revenue per available seat mile improved 1.7% year-over-year. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of positive revenue growth for American. When looking across the regions, the Atlantic was the best performing entity for the third consecutive quarter as we are able to grow load factors with only a minor impact on yield. Basic economy is doing well as is premium economy, and we see no impact from Brexit at this point. Moving to land, although slightly negative, we did see quarter to quarter improvements in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, which is encouraging. Foreign exchange had a negative impact on the quarter of 1.6 points. In the Pacific, the weaker markets got better while the better markets, Japan and Korea, got a little bit worse. We are negatively impacted by the timing of joint business settlements by approximately 2 point and foreign exchange by half of point. Despite very difficult comps, we saw improvements during the quarter in domestic yields, in part due to selling basic economy higher up the fare ladder and expanding into more markets. Looking forward, we are head on load factor each month as we see strong build further from departure. We are excited about our planned growth in DFW, which marks our first opportunity for sizable growth at one of our most profitable hubs since the merger. We faced headwinds in the March quarter of 0.5 point due to Easter shift, 0.7 points due to foreign exchange and 0.7 points from our advantage program, which is due to the big investments we have made over the past year in the program, making it much more valuable to our customers. We significantly increased the inventory available for redemptions in 2018, giving our customers more flexibility to use their miles. The net result of this change is that we'll be deferring more revenue from 2019 for recognition in later years. For the year, we expect the non-cash impact of 0.7. Even with these headwinds, we expect our first quarter year-over-year system TRASM to be up between zero and 2%. As we look forward into 2019, we are excited about what the future holds for American Airlines. Now that most of the distractions of integration are behind us, we are intently focused on running the best operations in America's history, improving our product and capitalizing on our network. We have more than $1 billion in revenue initiatives that we are confident that we will deliver, and we feel really good about how these are shaping up. We will continue to expand premium economy and fine tune how we offer basic economy across our network. We also expect to continue our fleet harmonization project and further optimize how we sell that product. And we expect to become more efficient with more than $300 million in cost initiatives in our plan. All of these initiatives are on track and expected to be earnings accretive this year. We\u2019re excited about the future and look forward to sharing these results as the year progresses. And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session. But first, we are going to give it to Doug.\nDoug Parker: Just before that operator, I just want to let everybody know that in addition to me and Derek and Robert and Dan here, we have a number of handful members of the best leadership team in the world and which include we have Ben Mimmack, Kenji Hashimoto, Elise Eberwein, Maya Leibman, Steve Johnson, Don Casey, Devon May, all here.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. We will take questions from analysts first and then we will take questions from the media [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Two questions here. Robert, just you were talking about basic economy and slowing it up, further up the fare ladder. And I'm just curious what that means? I think in the past, it was in a lower maybe four or five fare buckets. And the $5 improvement in the sell up deference to $26, typically you\u2019re dealing with a very price sensitive customer base at that part of the passenger segment base. Are you finding that that elasticity of demand maybe is less elastic and there's willingness to move up, because it's a much better product, you saw some of those?\nDon Casey: It's Donald Casey. High up the fair ladder just means we get where -- I guess we're just going to up the fare ladder higher. So it does vary from market but we're up about two -- on average about two inventories from we were about four months ago. As for elasticity at $5 fare increase that's we have in market right now. With that $5 fare increase, we've actually seen the sell up remain quite constant. So we don't think we've hit a point where the sell up amount is deterring people from buying up.\nMichael Linenberg: And then just second question on cost when you talk about your cost outlook for 2019, you call out that it doesn\u2019t include any labor agreements. What is it, are we down -- what is it one other labor group that has to get done. Is that -- I just want an update on that?\nDon Casey: Our IAM TWU negotiations, which represent a number of workers, largest of those are mechanics and fleet service works. Those are with the NMB right now and mediatory conversations, that's the only joint collected bargaining still to be done, Mike. It's been long enough into the merger that we're getting close to amendable dates on our products, employees, and as both of those become amendable toward one of them, one of them in December of this year and the other in January of 2020.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi : Robert, you mentioned the growth strategy focus in DFW and that's your highest margin hub. I'm wondering if you guys could maybe quantify that a little bit more, you've quantified it before by lumping it in with DCA and Charlotte. But can you get more granular and just tell us what the operating margin at DFW was or pretax margin was in 2018? I think that would help investors better appreciate why your growth is doing what it's doing?\nDerek Kerr: Just first off in terms of a little bit more granularity of our planned growth for this next year the roughly 3% growth year-over-year, DFW represents about two thirds of that. And so we're really pleased with that. And when you take a look at hub profitability, DFW, Charlotte, DCA, those are all our most profitable hubs. And so we see ourselves growing into incredible strength, and really look forward to be able take this opportunity. And I mentioned that this is really our first chance to grow one of our most profitable hubs. It's still keyed on having these additional gates. So we're really happy to get to this point and it's going to be mean big things for the company.\nDoug Parker: So anyway we don\u2019t make a habit of disclosing profitability by hub, it's one we haven\u2019t done that historically but also it varies a lot by time of year. But nonetheless what Robert said is where we are is certainly one of our more profitable hubs, certainly in terms of size and also the margins are well above the system average. We did at one point but its slide the other, which I know most of our investors have seen. I talked about the margins of those three hubs versus the rest of the system and anyway, that's we're trying keep doing that.\nDerek Kerr: DFW is twice the system average.\nDoug Parker: So anyways, it is definitely above system average. And again we're going to this -- we like other airlines when you add flights into those types of hubs they tend to come on at above system average margins as opposed to at marginal profitability.\nJoseph DeNardi : And then Derek, I don\u2019t want to beat you up too much on this. But I do feel like on the last call, there was some commentary that CapEx in 2020 wouldn\u2019t exceed 3 and wouldn\u2019t exceed 2 and now it seems like it is going to be higher. Can you just talk about what's driving some of that and whether this current CapEx outlook is firm at this point and investors can assume what you guys have guided to is actually going to materialize? Thank you.\nDerek Kerr: No, it\u2019s a fair question. We did right after the call at our last call, we had an option on 15 large RJs that we had not completed at that point in time and we didn't talk about it. So the real increase in 2020 is the 15 large RJs that will pretty close to max out our large RJ scope, so we don't expect any more. They will replace 50 seaters that are out there. So it's not for growth, because we have a number of regional aircraft that we can have. So that is the only one item that is out there that we had left for us. So I think we are pretty firm on 2020, 2021 where we're at from a CapEx number, but that wasn\u2019t an increase from where we said before, and it was 15 regional jets coming in 2020 timeframe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: First one for Robert or Don, the comment about outperforming your network competitors on RASM this year, I don\u2019t want to get into a modeling exercise here. But since the first quarter guide is in fact no different than Delta or United. Can you give us some color on what period you do expect to start overtaking the competition? I understand the $1 billion figure I guess. I guess I just don't understand what buckets phase in and when? For example, how much is the credit card step up contributing to that, any additional color?\nDoug Parker: We're very confident about the ready initiatives that we have and how that revenue flows in during the course of the year. We're also going to benefit in 2019 from either comps year-over-year, which were a drag on our performance this year. And so I think that goes back to -- and our investment in Dallas, I think it's going to be one of the big drivers of improvement for us and that doesn\u2019t start until we get into the summer.\nJamie Baker: And then for Derek or possibly Doug, can you give us a little bit more color as to how the full year capacity plan emerged. Specifically were you meaningfully above or below the 3% number at any point? What influenced the 3% outcome? Or put differently, did the marketing department or fleet planning potentially wield more influence on that? Just any genesis as to how the 3% came about would be useful.\nDoug Parker: I can step in on that. We grow, we take advantage of opportunities that we think are beneficial for the airline overall. As I said before, we're going to take advantage of opportunities, both in DFW and in Charlotte and DFW, two thirds of the overall growth. As you break down the rest of the growth, it's departures and into devices we think make a lot of sense. We have got some gauge that fits into that as well. And the reallocation of international flying as we talked about the restructuring of our international network is what results in the level that we're projecting for this coming year. So we're really confident that this is the right plan for American taking advantage of the assets that we have and well within our ability to execute on.\nJamie Baker: Well, just humor me then. If we were to roll back fuel prices and roll back your thought process to that of let's call the first week of October and where jet fuel has been. Would 3% still what you were thinking for 2019 at that point?\nDerek Kerr: This is Derek the level of ops was put together in September, October timeframe has not changed since the fuel prices changed. So that did not impact where we are from a capacity perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRajeev Lalwani: Doug, a question for you just on the '19 earnings guide. How do we get comfortable that you're not capturing the best of all worlds' in the guide? I mean, you've got lower fuel but then you've relatively steady RASM going forward, CASM continuing to get better. So I guess overall I mean, I think history shown us sell lower fuel leads to much weaker revenues as timing evolves, but you\u2019re showing that. So just trying to get comfortable with what you\u2019re putting out there I guess.\nDoug Parker: First of all, its forecasting airline earnings a year out we all know and we certainly learned. It has a lot of variability on it. So we put some variability and what we did is provided what we believe is for our investors our best guess at this point about where we\u2019re going to come in. And we feel quite comfortable with it we wouldn\u2019t have done it otherwise, as it relates to the point about fuel prices falling when fuel prices so do revenues. I would just note again what Derek just said. We haven\u2019t changed any of our capacity plans, because fuel prices are lower. I think it's important to replay what drives airline changes in capacity driven by fuel prices, and this doesn\u2019t feel anything like what maybe you've experienced in recent terms at least to us. We all know that back in 2015 actually oil prices have been over $100 for five years they fell down to $45, $50. And when they stayed there for a while when you see that kind of a change in the fuel price, you\u2019re going to see capacity coming in as you should. The cost of production drop that much, profitability goes up and production goes up. So that doesn\u2019t seem irrational, never seen irrational at the time. What\u2019s happened here is having stayed that level for whatever it was two and half to three years in the $45 to $50 range, oil prices ramped pretty quickly. Through 2017 and '18, we got at levels around $80 a barrel per Brent and above. And the industry was somewhat getting itself well at those levels, but not all the way and now it's corrected some of it but not nearly all of it. So I\u2019m not suggesting that this is going to correct all the way. What I\u2019m pointing out is simply this fall from -- I know these are rounded number here but from $80 barrel Brent to $60 barrel Brent, I don't think it makes -- I know for American Airlines it doesn't a wit of difference on how much where we are going to fly. I don\u2019t think it makes a wit of difference for the industry, frankly, because we hadn\u2019t got our self adjusted to run up to 80 and it falls back to 60 I think. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to make huge adjustments in revenue, but that\u2019s our view.\nRajeev Lalwani: And then a quick follow-up on that capacity side, and I think Jamie was asking about this earlier. So previously you had talked about sub GDP capacity growth, I think most of us were assuming 1% to 2% and now you\u2019re coming in at 3%, which is guess is GDP plus, maybe my general assumptions are incorrect. But can you just walk me through what changed if something did in fact changed?\nDoug Parker: I think Derek just said it doesn\u2019t change, and there are GDP estimates out there that certainly 3% and higher. So to the extent we produce the number other than what we announced today and this is right in line with what we've been thinking all along. And again, I would note, given where we're growing, we feel really comfortable with this level of growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay : I do want to continue on this line a little bit that Jamie brought up as well. And Dough, before -- you guys just said you're going to grow less than competitors, and now you are saying you're going to grow RASM more than competitors. And I appreciate that shift and that is a change. I'm hoping fuel prices aside for a second. Is there any change to how you guys are thinking about capacity in the context of market share and maybe are you kind of line of sight on better ops, you feel better about maybe, I don\u2019t know, let's say, sticking-up for yourself. But maybe being a little bit more tactically aggressive in keeping some share or it does make sense to do it, because again that change the drop of growing less than and now growing RASM than more than, is it changed. I'm wondering kind of what drove that language difference.\nDoug Parker: You said RASM, you mean ASMs?\nHunter Keay: Yes, you said you are going to grow ASMs less now you're saying you're going to grow RASM more. So it's a change. And I'm just kind of curious just to know what drove that language difference\u2026\nDoug Parker: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a change, but anyway I'll try again. So we have I believe consistently we've said that we believe where American Airlines is we have a largely mature network. And you should expect to see us grow at certainly domestically kind of in line with GDP growth. And that's what we've been doing. And this 3% number is not, I don\u2019t think dramatically different than that to the extent you assume there was something different in that. And any, we didn\u2019t mean to suggest anything other than that. We have not changed that number from the time we started producing level of ops as Derek said, six or nine months ago. So that hasn\u2019t been a change and indeed I think is entirely consistent with what we've said, which is we expect to grow somewhat in line with U.S. GDP growth. And also we did say, we think that's lower than we're seeing at competitor and that\u2019s certainly the case, and maybe a competitor that maybe a little bit lower than that, that\u2019s how we know if that's the case. But if we're not the lowest we're the second lowest at this number. So all of that seems entirely consistent to me with what we said in the past. We haven't made any changes to our capacity growth based upon anything other than where we see growth capabilities. And I can't stress enough the fact that when you get 10 gates at a hub -- 15 gates at Dallas-Fort Worth that's a huge growth opportunity. But despite that, we're growing in line with or maybe modestly higher depending on what your GDP estimates are in line with GDP.\nDerek Kerr: And I'll just add that our growth it's being funded by improved density from up-gauges and improved aircraft utilization.\nDoug Parker: And then the piece I was looking, Hunter, in RASM is growing faster. I don\u2019t think -- the fact that -- at those levels of capacity growth, we do believe that our unit revenues will still grow faster than the industries, because of the initiatives we have in place. But those are -- I don\u2019t think that's inconsistent, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: No, it's not. Again, I didn\u2019t mean for the question to be negative. Again, and this is just my -- I guess I'll just ask a true follow-up. Again, I'm just wondering if there's been a change in philosophy about how you're thinking about growth in the context of what's happening in the industry. I'm not saying your plan change, fuel or whatever. Are you just going to say like we're going to sort of start punching a little bit harder here and fight for what's ours and fight for share that we think we deserve? And philosophically, how you are thinking about that in the context of what's going in the broader competitive industry. And it's not that anything has changed with the plan, just philosophically, how you are thinking about capacity growth going forward.\nDoug Parker: Hunter, look we go back to look where a global hub and spoke airline, our greatest assets are our hubs and you will see us take advantage of opportunities in our hubs. And we are going to be incredibly competitive everywhere. The one thing I will say as well is I think we are being smart with how we deploy capacity as well and taking advantage of the dynamics of our hubs as well. So some of the things that you may see going forward is that from a seasonal perspective, some of the hubs Phoenix, Chicago performed better at certain points of the year than otherwise. And so you will see us flex to take maximum advantage of those opportunities. And the good news is that as we push for fleet commonality, as we have rationalized our regional partners and reduced sub fleets, as we have gotten through integration and now can make full use of our team, you are going to see us be very smart about making sure we take advantage of opportunities throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So just this EPS guidance is a relatively new experience for airlines and I am wondering if you could reflect on 2019, the execution versus that guidance, what are the lessons learned and how did that impact your guidance and your plans for 2019?\nDoug Parker: I don\u2019t think it's a secret, we reluctantly --. We were reluctant participants in this exercise, feeling really strongly that we think the best thing for us to do for our shareholders is not to try and project what the earnings are going to be but rather go run our business best we can and tell you what our plans are and let you do that. But also understand that it's important to a number of our shareholders that we at least give them more guidance in that. And as other airlines started giving full year EPS guidance, we chose to do as well. So we like you are somewhat -- as you say are somewhat new to this. Our experience last year was we ended up having to, which we adjusted downward a couple of times, which of course you don\u2019t like to do that was each time there was a reason. Given that again it seems logical, at the time had we known it, we wouldn\u2019t have the numbers as high as they were. So anyway, that\u2019s -- I don't know how other to explain it other than to say we are our best given the experience, I'll tell you this. We've certainly worked to make sure that we have a wide enough range that we feel comfortable, because we don\u2019t want to actually adjust it again and hope that we don\u2019t need to so we come up with a pretty wide range, but also done our best to give you a number that we feel really confident. And certainly last years' experience weighed on where we decided to set that guidance, because we don't want to have that experience again, no guarantee we won't but we don\u2019t want to.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then just for my follow-up, one of your peers has started to break out percent of revenue generated from premium products, and basically revenue away from the main cabin and the implied higher growth embedded in those initiatives. Have you studied that disclosure at all and would it make sense for American also? Thanks for taking the questions.\nDoug Parker: We have looked at it. We in the fourth quarter I think had a slightly different metric just looking at premium cabin performance. Premium cabin performance actually drove about a third of our overall unit revenue growth in the fourth quarter.\nDerek Kerr: And Duran, this is Derek. We looked at it as we go into 2019. And maybe something that we break out further, it's not easy to put things in all these buckets. But we will look at it more in 2019 to determine whether we want to break out the P&L little bit further. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open. \nHelane Becker: So two questions. One, can you say what the biggest bucket is in terms of the billion dollars in incremental revenue this year. And my second question if you pulled your customers, what would there number one compliant be about the airline and how are you addressing that?\nDoug Parker: So the biggest bucket is really what we're doing in terms of segmentation, so basic and premium economy are the two largest drivers. Then as we take a look in that billion dollars, we've talked about big opportunities within segmentation. We've talked about big opportunities within merchandising. Those we hope are willing to start kicking in later in the year. And the final bucket that we see a lot of opportunities is network, and we've talk about DFW and getting to 900 departures but as well that involves restructuring the network and making sure that we're putting aircraft where they want to go. In terms of the customer feedback, we know what the biggest point of concerning issue with our customers and that is they want a reliable airline, they want to be certain that they are getting what they paid for. And so from that perspective as we take a look at our goals for the coming year that is top of mind everywhere. And for us its upside, we didn\u2019t perform as well as we wanted to in 2018. We expect to reverse that very quickly. And we're pleased with the kind of things were seeing, especially over the holiday season and as we get into January.\nHelane Becker: So can you say, Robert, if your net promoter score again proved, let\u2019s say if you did it in January of '19 versus maybe July of '18?\nDoug Parker: No. So we have a lot of internal metrics and we have likelihood to recommend scores. And we weren\u2019t pleased with our likelihood to recommend scores. As a matter of fact, our own internal measures show they fell year-over-year for the first time in a number of years. And when you trace that back, it's certainly not due to the product that we've -- the investments that we've made in the product. People are very pleased with what they're getting in terms of service and in terms of the amenities and fleet and airports. But if you\u2019re not as reliable as you should be, as you want to be that has a negative impact overall. And so the good news on that and what we have seen is that when you do get back to the reliability that we aspire to things turn really quickly and we'll be able to take advantage of all those investments that we've made.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question Catherine O' Brian with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O' Brian: Maybe just one more on your comments about outperforming your peers on RASM this year. Could you talk about maybe like the one or two biggest drivers of that, help us size and help us to think about how they ran through the year. Is a lot of Dallas? Are we thinking more about premium economy? Just any color there would be really helpful.\nDon Casey: The two big things that are going to drive through really is DFW and the investment we're going to make in DFW in terms of the incremental flying and the relative revenue performance in DFW versus the rest of the system. The second one is just the merchandising capabilities, which we're going to be bringing online during the course of the year, which is one of our big revenue initiatives for 2019. And the reality is we're going to be helped a little bit this year on comps, they were a headwind in 2018 they'll be a bit of a tailwind in 2019.\nCatherine O' Brian: So it sounds like maybe we will start to see that outperformance pick-up starting second quarter on?\nDon Casey: That's correct.\nCatherine O' Brian: And then maybe just one more. So some of your peers know they were incorporating weakness across the Atlantic into their March quarter guide. Are you seeing the same thing and are you incorporating that guidance? And then how should we think about the ringing of your RASM by geography, going forward?\nDon Casey: So we look at the Atlantic, we expect -- Atlantic has been very strong. We had a -- it was our best-performing entity in the fourth quarter. We expect really a modest deceleration in our Atlantic performance in the first quarter, driven in large part due to additional of headwinds related to currency. Domestic, we've had very strong yield growth in large part to the expansion of the basic economy to more markets, as well as other price increases. We've seen strong corporate demand. Our negotiated corporate revenue domestically is up 10%, led by our professional services. And we're expecting kind of similar performance in 1Q '19, and that includes the impact we've seen to-date of the government shutdown and the impact of the Easter shift. In LATAM, we ended the quarter with modestly negative unit revenue growth, driven by our long haul operations. Although, we did see in the quarter that Brazil and Argentina did improve on a quarter-to-quarter basis and we're pleased with this given the currency and capacity environments in those markets. Mexico also improved quarter-to-quarter and positive unit revenue in the fourth quarter. And we saw demand recover, but the pricing environment in Mexico overall is still a bit soft. Caribbean was positive and had positive unit revenue growth, and we've experienced very, very strong unit revenue growth for last seven quarters, so a little well positive, not quite as positive on a quarter-to-quarter basis that\u2019s still expected to be positive going forward. And LATAM overall, in the fourth quarter, we had 1.6 points of headwind with currency. As we look forward to LATAM, we expect similar trends going forward with currency being an additional 0.5 point of headwind as we head into 2019. Encouraging for us is capacity in Brazil. We'll benefit from our own capacity reductions in Brazil in the first quarter. And as we head into the second quarter, the industry has taken out a material amount of seats. Pacific unit revenues slightly negative with Hong Kong, Japan and Korea all positive, although, not quite as strong quarter-to-quarter compared to third quarter of '18; China and South Pacific, although negative we are improving; and we expect Pacific to be the strongest performing quarter-to-quarter entity in the first quarter of '19.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey with Citi Group. Your line is open.\nKevin Crissey: If we could step back and talk about costs over time and the big picture. I've been a bit disappointed not seeing a better cost trajectory post merger. I know there were certainly some labor contracts catch up and that adds inflation. But I would've thought that they'd be pulled out post merger considering. I think a couple of percent CASM mix increase on a 3% capacity growth is kind of normal inflation for an airline, maybe its slightly lower, but not as low as I would expect post a merger. Can you talk about why there hasn\u2019t been more opportunity on the cost side there?\nDoug Parker: This is Doug and Derek can chime in. Again, I encourage you all get the details. We go through the details with Derek. Some of this is just depreciation expense and things like that that are driving these costs and timing of maintenance and other issues. But to your larger point, first off the labor issues is you already noted it, but can't ignore it. I mean we came out of a merger with the world's largest airline and a phenomenal group of team members who are working for the less than their peers at other airlines and that\u2019s -- we can't run an airline that way, nor should we ask our people to. So we've certainly had some increases in labor costs. We have largely closed those gaps versus our competitor airlines but that drove very large expense increases at American Airlines. And again, the expense increase is that we actually feel good about, because we needed to do that in order to produce -- to build the airline we want to build. Otherwise our costs again it's harder to address the qualitative response like that without a detailed response. But in general, what we know is we have gone through an effort led by Derek to go pull out expenses and it's been really successful. We had a relatively painful reduction in the management team around here and in the prior and the last year. And we will continue to do those things. What we know is if we weren\u2019t doing those things, well that number may not seem exciting to you, it would be about $300 million higher than it would have been otherwise without this work. So we continue to work at it and we will continue to work at it, but we feel really good about the cost discipline that we have instilled in American Airlines. Once we got to the point that we have our team being compensated in line with our peers.\nKevin Crissey: And maybe for Robert, you talked about the growth in the most profitable hubs. Can you talk about the actions you're taking in your less profitable hubs?\nRobert Isom: So that goes back to one of the comments made a little bit earlier. We are trying to be really smart about how we deploy capacity. So when we take a look at a hub perspective, we can now that we have got a lot of the integration behind us and certainly a lot more fleet commonality, we can take a look at Chicago during the summer, and it being really healthy for us at that point in time. And then at other points of the season, take a look at Phoenix and Miami, which can perform better. We've mentioned things about what we're doing with our international network. So from a China perspective, we've made some adjustments in our network there and have been redeploying assets to where they're most profitable. We have been taking a look at making sure that we're maximizing our opportunities with our joint business partners as well. So from a whole perspective, we're incredibly competitive in each of our hubs but we\u2019re making sure that we use them for what they do best for American. And you see that with the growth that\u2019s coming in DFW, you will see it with the growth that\u2019s coming next year in Charlotte and you'll see it when we get the regional terminal done in DCA the following year and our ability to up-gauge there. The plans that we have in place I think for this coming year in Phoenix, Philly, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, they are well at tuned to what we can do best at this year.\nOperator: We have time for one more question from our analyst before moving on to media. And our last analyst question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBrandon Oglenski: I guess, Doug or Robert, I think the market wants to believe here, I mean your stocks trading at 5 PE. If you can start to show some relative margin traction, I think people will be pretty impressed. But if we look at 2018, I mean, you guys lagged your network competitors that you want to benchmark against capacity and RASM here pretty significantly. And if I go back to 2017 analyst meeting, we had pretty big revenue initiatives plotted for 2018 I think which were above a $1 billion too. So I guess what sense of urgency does the organization have this year to really deliver on that billion dollar revenue target? Or is this just something where circumstances are going to dictate that maybe like to push out again?\nRobert Isom: Those initiatives we delivered primarily almost all in. Basically the economy actually didn\u2019t as it sorted out competitively didn't deliver the level of value that we had expected that would be. But the urgency has been high, remains high and we remain excited. The fact that our revenues didn't perform as well as some of our peers in 2018 is a combination of largely the fact where we fly. I'd point out again that when the performance in Latin America, particularly South America where we are much larger than our competitors versus they had a big impact on that number. And then in relation to one of them, of course they did a really nice job of getting an airline that wasn\u2019t performing particularly well performing well. But if you look on two years over two years against that airline, we're still -- our RASM is still up more than any of it. So the issue becomes more of an issue of some concerning to us is when you look to the fact that RASM versus Delta that was -- that have been closing every year since the merger widened in 2018, again, a lot of that\u2019s Latin America. But also as we look at it, the initiatives that Robert and Don described are some areas that they've done -- they're a little bit of ahead us. They merged well ahead of us. They've done a nice job. But things like the ability to get sell up into more channels and to more customers is something that we will be doing before too long has allowed them to widen that gap. So we're running full force, have been running full force. We'll continue to do an amazing job. But because of all those things, as we head into 2018, we remain confident in saying that we believe that in 2018, our unit revenue will outpace our competitors. But again, that's a forecast and it's dependent also upon what they do. But we said that last three quarters now, because we feel really good about where we are positioned not less -- more of a comment on where we are versus where they are and to the extent that they are doing things we don\u2019t know that may or may not be the case. But I did want to let our investors know that what we saw in '18 as our RASM declining versus our competitors for the first time in a few years wasn\u2019t something that we expect to continue.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our analyst question-and-answer-session. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Marry Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Your line is open.\nMary Schlangenstein : Can you guys talk about any financial impact from the government shutdown, Southwest and Delta have both put a number on that at least for the month of January. Can you talk about what you are seeing?\nDon Casey: We have seen some impact, but there is a lot of uncertainty as to what's going happen going forward. So we have not yet put a dollar value on it. But what we've seen today it is included in our guidance for the first quarter.\nMary Schlangenstein: And can you talk about what you are seeing. Is it just basically a decline in government -- business travel and government contactors travelling?\nDon Casey: It's a bit of softness in 0 to 14 day travel.\nMary Schlangenstein : And Don can you also talk a little bit about what your yields on closing business travel are looking like this first quarter? Are they higher than a year ago, or are they staying strong?\nDon Casey: We saw in the fourth quarter quite strong yields and actually the last two quarters in our 0 to 6 and 7 to 13 day booking windows, and we would expect that to continue going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Tangel with The Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.\nAndrew Tangel : A question on the shutdown as well this week unions for aircraft controllers, pilots and flight attendants are someday longer over the shutdowns effects on the U.S. aviation system and raised questions about safety and that would be entire system because at some point break. How concerned are you about that right now? And are you all seeing signs of stress or worry or any operational issues at this point?\nRobert Isom: First-off, our team in conjunction with our partners both at the FAA and from a security perspective TSA were always going to make the right decision for the safety and security of our team members and our customers. So there is no doubt, no lack of confidence in what we have in front of us. That said, we don't need distractions, we need people to be at work and confident and taking care of, and we do that at American with our team and we need to get our partners in a situation where they feel similarly confident in being taken care of.\nDoug Parker: To Roberts point, our business is so focused on safety that to the extent there are fewer TSA people are fewer air traffic controllers. What tends to happen is you get long lines at TSA, but still the same level of scrutiny. You get larger separation of aircraft, so you have delayed air space. It was really concerning to us. So that's what we feared may happen. We want to thank all the people at TSA and all of our air traffic controllers who are showing us without actually getting pay checks and taking care of our team, taking care of flying public, it's phenomenal what they're doing we appreciate what they're doing. And we would encourage our government to get them to a position where these hard-working people would be paid for what they're doing.\nAndrew Tangel : And as a follow up on something Don said, I'm going to go with reference to the quarter one outlook. You cited the potential for zero growth in the first quarter unit revenue to the government shutdown. Overall, are you all -- the shutdown aside or potential including the shutdowns. Are you all seeing any signs of an economic slowdown or any early signs of recession, any difficulty raising fares in the main cabin or premium seats or anything of that nature?\nDon Casey: And just to clarify I guess I'm not sure what your comment just about zero growth related to the government shutdown. We haven\u2019t really put a number on the government shutdown. And it is included in our guidance, which is 0% to 2%. So we are expecting positive unit revenue growth in the first quarter. As for looking at the rest of the business whether we are seeing any slowdown in bookings anywhere in the system, we are not. Our corporate demand continues to be strong and our held load factor position going forward is up materially on a year-over-year basis.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Your line is open.\nLeslie Josephs: On the corporate demand just to clarify. You said that it's higher this year than last year at the same point for January. I'm just trying to gauge the shutdown impact, and what there was I didn\u2019t catch that. And the other question is, are you still committed to flying to Venezuela?\nDon Casey: Corporate revenues so far this year have been up month to date. As far as Venezuela goes, we fly three times a day there and we intend to continue our service. It\u2019s a relatively small part of our business. It's 0.2% of our overall system revenue.\nLeslie Josephs: And then the shutdown, the impact you said bit of softness in the zero to 14 to day yields?\nDon Casey: That is correct.\nLeslie Josephs: But no dollar impacts that you are seeing so far?\nDon Casey: We are not going to disclose a dollar impact. We will look at it after the government gets back to where it can figure out how impactful it was.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Rucinski from Reuters. Your line is open.\nTracy Rucinski: I wanted to ask about China. I have seen some data out of China that shows that 20% decline in outbound traffic to the United States in the third quarter of 2018. Have you seen any decline in inbound traffic from China, particularly for shorter states?\nDon Casey: We have not. Now, we did take some capacity actions in China and we ended up suspending service from Chicago, Shanghai and Beijing, which probably helps us a bit more. But our advanced load factor in China looks fine.\nTracy Rucinski: So no impact from the ongoing trade\u2026\nDon Casey: We don\u2019t see any impact right now in our business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Biers with AFP. Your line is open.\nJohn Biers: Are you worried that there could be a hit related to the shutdown, either from people who are worried about safety, because of things like what the unions are saying about air traffic controllers and so forth or because they are worried about the delays to the system that the extra half-full of traveling? Just looking forward, is this something that could really hit demand in 2019?\nDoug Parker: Again, we would just encourage the government to get reopened, so that people can get paid. And there are customers who can rest assured that they won't be waiting in long lines or face delays. At the airport because of air traffic controllers that can't afford to show forth, that\u2019s what needs to happen. Demand remains strong and this is certainly not a long-term demand issue. Our government presumably will reopen again one day and hopefully not before too long. So it's certainly been long enough we\u2019re putting strain on people who have been working now without -- for missing a couple of paychecks and that will at some point result in people not being at work. When we don\u2019t have enough TSA agents, you will see longer lines. We don\u2019t have enough ATC controllers you will see more delays in aerospace. Those will be bad things. So far everybody's been phenomenal about doing it. We\u2019re concerned but we haven\u2019t seen any drop off in demand other than the moderate softness Don talked about in Slide 14, because it travelled during the shutdown itself. But demand for air travel remains strong, people are flying and I suspect they will continue to want to fly as we get the government opened up again.\nDon Casey: And remarkably, people are doing a fantastic job of keeping the aircraft and airports moving. And so, we're really confident in what we\u2019ve seen so far in terms of operations and thankful to all those that are doing their jobs.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our last question comes from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly. Your line is open.\nRobert Silk : Can you tell me if you all have any plan and NDC initiatives plan in the coming year and what those might be if you do?\nDon Casey: We do have plans. We've announced them to the marketplace. And we continue to plan to expand our NDC offering. Now, our approach to this is to improve the product offering that we\u2019re able to deliver through NDC. So that our agency partners are able to service customers more effectively and that's our focus going forward.\nRobert Silk : Will you work in -- increase for the channels that you worked through NDC, more direct connects or more -- or going through any of these exchanges I should say or any of these approaches?\nDon Casey: Well, I mean, again our plan is to continue to expand the use of NDC with everyone that is interested because we think we're going to be able to deliver more product and better products to their customers.\nDoug Parker: Thanks operator. Thanks everyone for your interest, and thanks in particular to the American Airlines team for taking care of each other and our customers. We're excited for 2019 and we appreciate your interest. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.\nDaniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to the American Airlines Group third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call this morning is Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Finance Officer. Also in the room for a question-and-answer session are several of our senior executives, including Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Elise Eberwein: our EVP of People & Communications; and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management. Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the third quarter and provide some additional information on guidance for the fourth quarter. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then, after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions, and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and cost, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 that was also issued this morning. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website. A webcast of this call will be archived on the website as well, and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thanks again for joining us. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Thanks everyone for joining us. Today, we reported third quarter 2018 pre-tax profit of $688 million, excluding net special items. Those results include our highest ever revenue performance, thanks to our 130,000 hard-working team members. But unfortunately, a rising fuel prices outpaced that increase in revenues. Higher jet fuel prices alone increased our quarterly expenses by over $750 million versus the same quarter last year. And therefore, our pre-tax earnings, excluding specials for the quarter, were $485 million lower than the third quarter 2017. The declining earnings has been met with a declining stock price, which neither we nor our investors are happy about. The good news is, we're extremely bullish on the future of American and for good reason. This disconnect between the stock price and our view of the future seems to us like a buying opportunity, and we're happy to be here to talk to you all about it. So, look, there are five reasons that we're so bullish. First, we have extensive revenue initiatives underway that are expected to bring more than $1 billion in revenue improvements to American in 2019 versus 2018. Importantly, the drivers of this value are not share shift because of a better product like new airplanes or industry-leading Wi-Fi or world-class clubs and lounges, though we certainly believe some upside exist in that regard. This is a value that'll happen as we simply execute against known projects such as project segmentation, fleet reconfiguration and international network restructuring. Second, and we also expect about $300 million in cost improvements in 2019 versus this year. That's the result of our One Airline project, which has been expanded and accelerated in light of higher fuel costs and Derek will discuss that further. Third, we have the opportunity to grow where we have a real competitive advantage. We have, what we believe, will be the lowest growth plans in the industry for 2019, but we also have what we believe are the best growth prospects. We have 15 gates opening at our largest and most profitable hub in Dallas/Fort Worth in early 2019. We have routes in and out of Dallas/Fort Worth that will immediately generate higher than average profitability versus the marginal profitability that airline growth usually generates. Fourth, we're dedicated to improving our operating reliability. And we've been steadily improving the operating reliability of American according to plan in each year since our merger in late 2013. But that trend changed in the summer of 2018, and we backed (00:05:04) a little bit. As Robert will discuss, we've rededicated ourselves to producing the best operational reliability since our merger in 2019 and that's our top corporate priority. The work has already begun showing some great results, so this is an even more upside for 2019. And then fifth, we are nearing the end of our major post-merger capital expenditure requirement. Our capital expenditures in American have averaged $5.3 billion per year in the five years since the merger. That over $25 billion is by far the most any carrier has invested in its fleet, product and team in the history of commercial aviation. And the result is a valuable set of assets that'll serve our shareholders well for decades to come. And we're going to spend a little under $5 billion in 2019 as we have one more aircraft order to fund. But after that, we're largely done with the backlog. And our CapEx drops precipitously to approximately $3 billion in 2020, $2 billion in 2021 and we expect it will remain in the $2 billion to $3 billion range thereafter. So, because of all of those items, we're excited about our near and long-term future. We're confident that American will return to revenue outperformance and earnings growth in 2019 and beyond. Now, it sounds like we're extremely optimistic because we are, but please don't mistake confidence for indifference. We're extremely focused on results and execution and completing the hard work necessary to deliver this value. We've just happen to be confident it will happen because we know we have the right plan in place and the right people to deliver it. We look forward to proving that over time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek and Robert.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Okay, thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to recognize and thank our team who have had to contend with some very challenging weather conditions during the quarter. Their hard work and willingness to go above and beyond on behalf of our passengers in some very difficult circumstances is appreciated by us all. We filed our third quarter earnings press release and 10-Q this morning. While this was another profitable quarter for American Airlines, earnings were lower due primarily to a 38% increase in average fuel cost per gallon. Excluding net special items, we reported a net profit of $523 million in 2018 versus our 2017 net profit of $729 million, which included a negative impact to pre-tax earnings from Hurricane Florence for approximately $50 million. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding net special items in the third quarter of 2018, was $1.13 per share, and excluding net special items our third quarter pre-tax profit was $688 million with a pre-tax margin of 6%. Our total operating revenues were 5.4% to $11.6 billion, the highest third quarter revenue in American Airlines' history. On a unit revenue basis, total revenue per ASM was up 2.6% and this was the eighth consecutive quarter in which we achieved positive unit revenue growth. Passenger revenues were $10.6 billion, a 4.6% improvement driven in part by a 2.2% improvement in yields. The third quarter saw another excellent performance by our cargo organization. For the third quarter, cargo revenue was $260 million, a 16.4% improvement year-over-year driven primarily by a 12.1% improvement in yields. Other revenues were up 14.5% driven primarily by continued strength in our loyalty program. Total operating expenses were $10.9 billion, up 12.4%. The primary driver of this increase was the higher fuel price, I mentioned earlier, which drove approximately $750 million of year-over-year incremental expense. As a result, consolidated cost per ASM was up 9.4% year-over-year. In this increasing fuel cost environment, we continue to make the reduction of non-fuel cost a priority. When we initially provided guidance on our third quarter of 2018 back in January, we projected that fuel would be at approximately $2.10 a gallon and at CASM excluding fuel and special items would increase by approximately 1.5% on ASM growth of close to 4%. As fuel cost increased throughout the year, we worked to eliminate non-essential costs from the organization while at the same time optimizing our network and focusing on reducing unprofitable capacity. As a result of these efforts, our third quarter consolidated CASM excluding fuel and special items was up only 0.8% year-over-year on an over 100-basis-point reduction in system capacity growth to 2.7%. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $7.4 billion in total available liquidity. During the quarter, our treasury team completed several transactions including a $500 million upsize of our London Heathrow term loan as well as securing financing for certain 2019 aircraft deliveries. We now have financing for all mainline aircraft deliveries through June of 2019. In addition, the company made $156 million contribution to its defined benefit plans. For the year, we have made $467 million in pension contributions. One benefit of the rising interest rate environment is that it reduces our pension liability, which all else being equal, will lower future pension funding obligations and improve our free cash position in the medium to long-term. As of today, we estimate our GAAP liability has reduced by $2 billion from the start of the year and our 2019 cash contribution has reduced by about $110 million to $780 million based on year-to-date asset performance. We have lowered our adjusted debt including pensions by $743 million since the beginning of the year. Now that our fleet renewal program is winding down, we continue to believe that our 2018 year-end adjusted debt will be lower than at the end of the third quarter and we expect that over the next few years this trend will continue as we naturally de-lever the company. We did not repurchase any stock during the third quarter, leaving our available authorization for stock buybacks unchanged at $1.65 billion. The fact that we did not repurchase any stock is not due to a change in our belief that the stock is undervalued. As we have consistently said, our priorities for our use of cash are: number one, to meet our outstanding obligations when due; two, to make appropriate investments in the business; and finally, to opportunistically return any excess liquidity to shareholders. We define excess liquidity as anything above the very high level of $7 billion. As fuel prices rose earlier this year, we began to forecast the year-end cash balance near that $7 billion target level so we stopped repurchasing our shares. We're extremely bullish on AAL and would be aggressive buyers at these levels, but maintaining $7 billion of target liquidity is a key component of our capital allocation strategy and we won't violate it to repurchase shares irrespective of our bullishness. We filed our investor update this morning, which includes our guidance for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our previous guidance given on the last earnings call, we continue to expect our full-year system capacity growth will be just over 2%, down significantly from our expectations of approximately 3% at the beginning of 2018. Despite this reduction, we continue to believe that our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM ex-fuel and special items will be flat, and our full-year 2018 CASM will be up approximately 1.5%, down 50 basis points from our expectations in January of 2018. Given the run-up of fuel over the past few months, we continue to expect higher fuel expense in the fourth quarter of 2018. Based on the fuel forward curve as of October 24, we are forecasting an increase in consolidated fuel expense of 33% or $2.5 billion for the full-year 2018. For the full year, we now anticipate our fuel price to be between $2.22 to $2.27 per gallon. We also guided to a fourth quarter 2018 TRASM increase of 1.5% to 3.5% to which Robert will provide more details on in his remarks. With our combined revenue and cost guidance, we expect our fourth quarter of 2018 pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, to be between 4.5% and 6.5% and our full-year 2018 earnings per share, excluding net special items, guidance to be between 4.5% and 5%. We are still in the process of developing our plan for 2019. With fuel prices remaining high, we are once again revealing our capacity plans as we're in the middle of our budgeting process. We continue to expect our ASM growth in 2019 to be in line with or below estimated GDP growth and amongst the lowest of the industry. Our capacity growth in 2019 will come primarily from our unique opportunity to add incremental flying to Dallas/Fort Worth, our most profitable hub, as well as our fleet modernization project to add existing seats to our narrowbody aircraft, which allows us to grow capacity in extremely efficient way. In addition to this margin-accretive growth, we are confident of successful execution on our business plan, which we continue to believe will include an incremental $1.3 billion in revenue and cost opportunities for 2019. Given this level of capacity and the incremental cost opportunities, we continue to expect that our CASM growth in 2019 will be in the 1% to 2% range that we previously guided, and we'll have a better read once we finish our 2019 planning process by year end. In terms of capital expenditures for 2019, we continue to expect that we will spend $2.9 billion on aircraft CapEx, as we take delivery of new large RJs that replace 50 seaters along with narrow-body aircraft to replace our MD-80 fleet that we'll retire after next summer. We now believe our non-aircraft CapEx will be $1.7 billion in 2019, $100 million lower than previous guidance. After 2019, most of our integration projects will be complete. At that time, our obligations reduce considerably. And we estimate that total CapEx will be $2.9 billion in 2020 and $2.2 billion in 2021, thus allowing us to generate significant free cash flow. During 2018, we have adjusted to higher costs by reducing capacity growth, slowing non-fuel CASM growth by pulling forward some of our One Airline cost initiatives, and lowering our capital expenditures by deferring aircraft. Going forward, we will continue to focus on growing network profitability, executing on our revenue opportunities, and further lowering costs throughout the airline. We have an exciting long-term vision for American Airlines, and we're pleased with the success of our efforts in 2018. We will continue on this path, as strengthening our business in the short term will allow us to take full advantage of the opportunities available to us in the medium and long term. In conclusion, I would like to once again thank our entire team for their hard work, a challenging quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Derek, and good morning, everybody. In October, we successfully completed our largest integration project to date, moving all 27,000 American flight attendants into one scheduling system. The benefits and efficiencies we'll gain are wide-reaching. Our flight attendants are no longer limited to flying on their legacy carrier's aircraft, and will have the flexibility to move to different bases. For our customers, we'll be able to recover more quickly following irregular operations. And it removes the friction point from how we schedule our aircraft and crews, giving us more operational flexibility and the ability to optimize our network and drive efficiencies. This was a massive four-year effort by our team, who invested more than 6.2 million hours to ensure our success. I want to thank all of our team members who worked behind the scenes to prepare us and on the front-line, who have seen an enormous amount of change. Progress on integration is one reason our operation is set to improve. Since the merger and up through this past winter, American had been making steady progress in improving core operating reliability while also achieving important merger milestones. However, this past summer we fell short of our targets that we had set for ourselves. While there are factors like inclement weather and unexpected increases in workload associated with some aircraft types that contributed to our underperformance, we know that we must do better, and we will. To that end, our immediate focus is on making sure that our fleet is ready to go each morning and that we resource our team to turn aircraft on time throughout the day. We have taken immediate short-term actions and launched a comprehensive review of our planning processes to ensure that we are ready to deliver better service during peak schedule periods, like the summer and year-end holidays. Our efforts are already paying dividends, as evidenced by two successive zero cancellation mainline operations this past week. And we're also operating at greater than 99% mainline completion factor so far in October, despite difficult operating conditions at DFW and also dealing with Hurricane Michael. On that note, I have to point out what an incredible job our teams across the system did to recover from both Michael and Hurricane Florence in September. In both instances, our teams were well prepared, and the greatest testament to that is how quickly we got the operation back up and running, especially out on the East Coast. On the product side, we've talked a lot about the $25 billion we have invested since our merger in people, facilities, and product, laying the foundation for a more efficient and reliable airline, and we're not done yet. We continue to make significant investments in our product, and we'll continue to grow our Flagship First Dining, our Flagship First Lounges with DFW opening in the first quarter of 2019. We're also investing more in our Admirals Club network with refresh projects in Boston, Charlotte B, and also in Pittsburgh in the first half of 2019. We have significantly enhanced connectivity on board by adding high-speed Wi-Fi and in-seat power. Half of our long-term domestic mainline fleet now has high-speed Wi-Fi, and installations will be complete by next summer. We are adding live TV to our domestic mainline fleet, a product our international customers have been enjoying since 2016. These transformational investments in our product, which touch every point of the customer's journey, will drive higher revenues and improve customer perception. We continue to play to our strengths when it comes to our network, adding high-quality, high-margin growth and redeployment opportunities at our most profitable hubs. Our 2018 domestic network additions to Dallas/Fort Worth and Charlotte produced margins far above our system average. And in 2019, we'll continue to capitalize on that strength by adding 15 gates and 100 departures per day at DFW. In 2020, we will add seven new gates at Charlotte, enabling another 75 daily departures. In 2021, the new regional terminal will open at Reagan National, allowing us to up-gauge to 76-seat regional jets at 14 gates, which today as a practical matter are limited to 50-seat regional jets. Our sales team has been executing well on its strategies. In the third quarter, we saw corporate revenue growth outpacing top line revenue on improved average ticket values. We have a healthy pipeline of new corporate accounts and made a number of advancements for customers, including our integration with SAP Concur TripLink so that our corporate customers can now book travel through aa.com while still receiving their company's negotiated rates. We also launched a partnership with Alibaba to accept Alipay on aa.com in China. Alipay is China's most popular form of payment. American is uniquely positioned with the largest airline loyalty program in the world. AAdvantage is a key asset for us and our customers, adding $4.2 billion in revenue for the first nine months of 2018. We have a valuable co-brand model with great partners in Citi, Barclays, and MasterCard. In the third quarter, we saw strong year-over-year acquisition growth with lower than expected attrition and continued growth in card spend. We are excited about the enhanced benefits we announced to our Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select card in May and the introduction of a no fee co-brand card in July, the AAdvantage MileUp card. These recent additions to our portfolio build on our already strong value proposition to customers, helping to ensure that an AAdvantage co-brand card is the primary card for even more travelers. Looking to 2019, we'll continue to find new ways to provide choice and value to our customers in our loyalty and co-brand programs. Our segmentation strategy is performing well. Premium Economy is now installed on 92 aircraft, and the customer adoption of this highly differentiated product has been strong. We also continue to be encouraged with the average fare differential, which is double the coach fare, as customers continue to buy up from main cabin. Installations remain on track and will be complete by next summer. As we look into 2019, we will further monetize this product with new revenue management and merchandising capabilities. In September, we made Basic Economy more competitive by removing the carry-on bag restriction, allowing us to offer Basic Economy to more markets more often. The early results are very positive and have exceeded our initial expectations, with approximately three times more customers now buying up to a higher fare for our main cabin product. Basic Economy is offered across the entire domestic network as well as most of the Atlantic, Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America. Our third quarter revenue was up 5.4% year over year to $11.6 billion, setting a record for any third quarter. As Derek mentioned, we saw double-digit growth in our cargo and other revenues, driven in part by continued strength in co-brand credit card acquisitions and cardholder spend. TRASM improved 2.6% year over year, above the midpoint of our initial guidance and marks the eighth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth. We saw sequential improvements during the quarter in domestic yield and that momentum has continued into the fourth quarter. We also realized strong performance in our international business, particularly across the Atlantic. There, we saw double-digit growth in passenger revenue and a 7.7% year-over-year increase in unit revenue. The solid improvement was driven by strong yield performance in our premium cabin and the continued benefits of our segmentation strategy, led by the Premium Economy and Basic Economy products. As we had anticipated, our Latin America performance was a little challenging during the quarter due to macro concerns in Argentina, political uncertainty in Brazil and a soft pricing environment in Mexico. The remainder of our Latin America network is performing well with notable strength in the Caribbean and Central America. Overall, revenue for the region still grew by 2.3%, albeit on 4% higher capacity, 2.6-percentage-point lower loads and an encouraging 1.5% higher yield. Unit revenue grew in the Pacific for the fourth consecutive quarter with PRASM up 2.4% year-over-year. Premium cabin performance remained strong, with Japanese and Korean markets showing the best performance year-over-year. Looking forward, we see continued strength in bookings as the demand for our product remains strong. Despite a very tough fourth quarter comparison, we expect our year-over-year system TRASM to be up 1.5% to 3.5% in the December ending quarter. This will be our ninth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth. As we approach the end of our integration, we have the opportunity to pursue a number of initiatives that in many cases have already been implemented by our competitors and have been in our plan for a long time. In 2019, we'll increase revenues by $1 billion thanks to optimizing our Basic Economy product, expanding the use of Premium Economy seats, further refining our suite of revenue management tools, continuing our fleet harmonization project and many more items. We also expect to become more efficient with more than $300 million of cost initiatives in line of sight and the hub optimization at DFW I mentioned. That will be beneficial to margins and probability relative to the competition. We're very excited about the future. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and begin our Q&A session. Operator?\nOperator: And our first question is from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning everybody. Doug, in a presentation you did last fall, I guess, it was this fall, I think it was (00:27:21) event, you cited that your aggregate margin performance in, I think it was Charlotte, Dallas, and Washington, and what that implied for your other hubs was comparatively poor round numbers, and implied that Chicago, Phoenix, and Miami were a little bit less than half as profitable as the best hubs. I certainly have my views as to what the drivers are for that potential disparity, again, this is all back of the envelope, but I am curious to hear what you think the drivers might be and whether there are any solutions for those weaker hubs?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Jamie. First, let me clarify because also on those numbers we include LAX and New York, right. So you shouldn't assume that that's Miami, Chicago and Phoenix.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's fair. That's fair.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: So, but nonetheless fair point. I think as you look at \u2013 anyway, what I'd tell you is, again, every airline I've been at it's often the case. You have some parts of the system that do better than others, but they all contribute to the system. And indeed that's certainly the case with operations like JFK, like our LA and New York operation, and indeed our Miami operation right now, certainly is underperforming on a financial basis given the economics of the region. So, but Chicago, Phoenix were solid. And does others will be solid over time, or they contribute to the rest of the system because of what they provide us and our ability to serve the corporate travel. So, it won't be same. We're really happy with the route network as it exists today. Expect no changes and particularly happy with the fact that we have the ability now to grow in those that are the most important \u2013 well, not most important, I shouldn't say, but those that have the highest profit generation capabilities DFW, Charlotte and DCA. And we've done a nice job, I think, of filling out all the rest of the others to a critical mass. Do you want to add anything to that?\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hey, Jamie. I just wanted to add though, in terms of the kind of adjustments we're making, we do think that in all of our hubs whether it's growing or redeploying assets to Charlotte, DFW and DCA that that will make those even stronger. But some of the actions that we've recently taken are specifically designed to ensure that places like Chicago and Miami perform better as well. And so, we know that the reductions in the Chicago up to Asia flying is definitely going to help there. You know about the gate initiatives that we've made, which further strengthen the connectivity capabilities of Chicago as a domestic connecting hub for us. And then in terms of Miami as well, we have some underperformers, S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte that we've made adjustments to and we're keeping an eye on all of South America to make sure that we're strong as possible.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Appreciate. I'm sorry. Something else?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: No. I said thanks to Robert. Go ahead.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And thank you, Robert, as well. And a follow-up for you, Robert. You talked enthusiastically quite a bit about the operations. When it comes to fuel, it's a fairly simple analysis to calculate how much time is required by the airline or the industry to recoup higher prices. What I'm not able to figure out is, when operations improve, how long does it take to win back some of the corporate share that you might have shared it in recent years? So first, do you have an opinion on that lag; and second, what level of corporate share recapture, if any, does your internal 2019 forecast assume?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Well, first off, Jamie, let me tell you, there hasn't been any loss in corporate share at American. We've had a really solid quarter in corporate revenue, as I mentioned, growing faster than top line revenue growth. And as we take a look, it's broad strength across the corporates led by professional services. We've got a healthy pipeline of new accounts. 450 new managed corporate accounts signed just this past quarter and a lot of enhancements coming. We haven't seen any weakness or fall off. And as a matter of fact, we're really pleased with what we've seen and improving operation is only going to drive more benefit.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: And the 2019 numbers don't assume any sort of increase. So, I think, if there's and that will be upside, Jamie.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Sure. Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hey, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Hey, thanks. Appreciate the question. So, you've been pretty conservative and pretty subdued with your domestic capacity growth. And I wonder if you could just expand a little bit on kind of the 3Q performance, because 1% domestic RASM relative to peers relative to what frankly the economy did, what happened there? How do you see that going forward? And how did you post 2%, 3% domestic revenue in the third quarter?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Okay, this is Don. I'll take this one. Again, if you go look at our domestic performance, what we see is improving trends. If you look at our third quarter performance, our unit revenue performance in domestic was better than our second quarter unit revenue performance, which was also positive. We're seeing improved yields in the domestic business not only in the third quarter, but in particular as we look forward into the fourth quarter. Lot of this is driven by changes in the pricing environments, particularly, in ULCC markets. Business demand remains pretty robust. We're seeing improvement in close in yields. Strong corporate demand, Robert mentioned that. Our domestic corporate revenue grew at 10% in the quarter and that remains continues to be positive as we look forward. So, as we look at our domestic performance, we, again, saw improvement as we went from Q2 to Q3, and we expect as we're looking into the Q4 outlook that domestic will improve again.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thanks, and then just a quick follow-up for Derek. Can you speak to the pension gains that were in non-op in 2018? And how you see those trending into 2019? Thanks for taking the questions.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: The pension gains will they stay for another three years I think, and then run-off, but they year-over-year will be the same as in your 2019 model of the pension gains.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thank you.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much. Doug and Derek, you talked about the CapEx profile coming down in 2021. Just want to be crystal clear that those numbers have moved around a little bit it feels like the past couple years or so. Are you guys both committing to no more than $3 billion CapEx in 2020 and no more than $2 billion in 2021?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: It's an estimate. Go ahead, Derek.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah, I wouldn't say we'll commit to anything, but I think, I mean they've moved and they've been pushed out and it's really driven by the deliveries. So, yes, we're set with the deliveries in 2019, 2020, 2021. And the aircraft deliveries, from an aircraft CapEx, 2020 is about $1.2 billion and 2021 is $1 billion and 2022 is $1.3 billion. And we have no reason to change that. So, I would say, yes that is where we're going to be from a total CapEx perspective. And the run rate, as we go forward, should be in that 2.5% range steady state even going forward from there, because we don't have any plans for any new aircraft at this point in time going forward since we've already really gotten through the fleet replacement program and taken on over 600 new aircraft now since the merger.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, Joe, anyways, what we believe and I think it's a belief that make sense, let just share the assumption behind it, which is what Derek has said, which is, we don't have any need at this point for additional aircraft to replace older aircraft, which we did have over time and that's what the current plan calls for. I guess, the only way it would go up from that is for some reason, we decide we want to grow like in excess of what we currently believe then we go decide, we need to go find other aircraft. But anyway, that's...\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah. And Joe, there is only one \u2013 I mean, from a fleet perspective, we still have some 50-seat aircraft that we'd like to replace with larger gauge aircraft, two-class aircraft. And we haven't committed that yet and looked at that. So, we have an opportunity in the regional space, and that's really the only place. From a mainline and widebody aircraft, everything is really in place for the next four, five years.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, Robert, you mentioned something in your prepared remarks about a credit card you guys have with Citi and Barclays; that sounds pretty exciting.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: It is.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Robert, in respect for my colleagues, can you spend 90 seconds talking about that? Assume I know nothing about the partnership, how do you guys get value? How does the business work? Would love to hear more. Thank you.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: All right. Well, first off, we have to start with the AAdvantage program. So, our loyalty program, which is the largest program and we believe the best out there in the business. As a benefit, there is the opportunity to align with partners. And in this case, we're aligning with Citi and Barclays. So, they can brand their credit card and offer benefits to their customers when they acquire credit cards and then also spend on those credit cards by earning miles that are redeemable ultimately in our program. American is obviously paid for those miles. Those miles are a nice business for us and something that we are able to offer customers value for that keep people really interested. At the end of the day, the value is in the American brand, the value is in \u2013 the service that American offers find people to the places that they want to go and that is something that a lot of different partners want to be part of, and in this case, Citi and Barclays.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'll take it. Thank you.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nJ. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. I just had a question on the cadence and the timing of when the new gates are going to open up and how impactful the redeployment of some of the capacity into those better margin hubs is going to be, like how should that affect the trajectory of earnings as you move through 2019?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Derek, can help me out a little with this, but the gates are going to start layering on in May and we'll fill them up over time as the summer progresses. And in terms of benefits in either growth or redeployment opportunities that will layer in. And we haven't yet given any estimates on how much that will improve, but we do know that it is going to be profitable for us.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah, I agree. And David that's not included in the $1 billion revenue synergies or revenue opportunities that we talked about. We're working to get those gates open as soon as we can, and we'll layer that in as we move forward from a revenue perspective into the 2019 forecast.\nJ. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hey, Hunter.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, good morning. Hey, Doug. So, you guys talked about corporate revs being strong, you're not the only one, but you're also paying for that again with these TMC commissions, they're up hugely across the industry, but I know there's been a little bit of an effort in the industry early this year to sort of get back some of the front-end commissions you're paying to the TMCs. I'm wondering, A, how that's going? How we should think about the trajectory of these TMC or these agency commissions going forward? And if you want to include how NDC ramping may help to offset some of these agency commission expense that'd be great. Thank you.\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Okay, Hunter. This is Don. In terms of commission expenses, this is really competitive marketplace, right. So, we really focus on competitiveness and that's really the focus, right. So, in terms of trajectory and TMC or any kind of commission costs, we've been actually relatively flat. And where going forward is really to stay competitive with our big competitors on a network basis. As for NDC, our focus on NDC is to improve the products, right, that we offer to our customers particularly our corporate customers. And it is less of a cost initiative for us than it is an ability to be able to put more products and particularly bundled products in front of our corporate customers.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay, thanks, Don. And then, Steve Johnson, one question for you. Can you talk \u2013 the UK is announcing that it's going to review the existing ATI you have with BA. I was surprised by this. A lot of people that know things were surprised by this, no one better than I do on this topic were surprised by it. Can you tell us what they are going to be examining? And if you want to fold that into a broader conversation about how regulators are viewing ATI and JVs in general these days that'd be great. Thank you.\nStephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Sure, Hunter. Thanks. It's really good question. And, first, I suppose if you were surprised shame on us a little bit. The arrangement with the Atlantic joint business has always been that it would be reviewed by the European regulators in advance of its 10th anniversary, which is in 2020. As Brexit is unfolded, that responsibility moved from the EU to the UK, and they for reasons I think are they just had the resources available to start doing the review now. We are very optimistic about how the review is going to come out. These joint businesses really provide fabulous consumer benefits, and all of the studies that we've done of the Atlantic joint business, in particular in JVs in general, have demonstrated that. And there certainly is no joint business that has come close to what we've been able to produce for consumers than our Atlantic joint business. I suspect the review will take a few months. There will be, I'm sure, a report written at some point in time, but our expectation is that they are going to firmly endorse the Atlantic joint business and reach conclusions like the ones that I just described. I maybe can just take a minute to go on. This work that we've done to review joint businesses, there have now been 17 or 18 years of robust data from joint businesses. And we've assembled it and put it into our advocacy around our Qantas joint business application and our two applications that are forthcoming. It's really very compelling. And we expect both the UK and the United States DOT to recognize that and firmly endorse the joint business concept going forward.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you, Steve.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Hunter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Robert, you mentioned that with the change in your carry-on bag policy that you're seeing three times the number of passengers now buying up, and I guess presumably that's just because you're able to offer the Basic Economy in a lot more markets. As I recall though, I think that you weren't initially pleased about the percentage about the buy-up, maybe it was under 50%. Can you give us a sense of maybe how that percentage is trending with the recent change in policy?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Mike, it's Don.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Don.\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: We're actually ahead of what our expectations are for this launch. So when we launched it, the change in the carry-on bag restriction, we knew that that would allow us to have the product in more markets more often. And we expected as part of that that we would see the sell-up rate go down, but the number of customers selling up go up, and that rate is going to be positive for us. What we observed is that the percentage of customers buying up hasn't materially changed. So we expect to see that drop from the low 60s down to about 50%, but it's still sitting around 60%. So that's actually much better than we expected.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, very good. And then my second question, and I'm not even sure who can answer this, as it relates to Venezuela. I saw the news out that I guess airlines doing business in that country will have to transact in their cryptocurrency, the petro. Just curious about whether or not that actually is going to impact you and whether or not that's legit or not, any color on that.\nStephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.: There shouldn't be. We sell only in dollars. And those markets, although we've reduced our capacity pretty significantly in Venezuela, continue to be really very profitable for us.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: And I'll just add. Venezuela, just to give you an idea, it's 0.2%of our system revenues, so we don't have a lot of exposure there anyway.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, very good. Okay, thanks.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thanks. Your next question is from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, good morning.\nDaniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hey, Savi.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: One quick follow-up before my question. On the regional trend, is it fair to assume domestic is going to continue to sequentially improve, which it just sounds like from your comments? But what about the other regions from a sequential standpoint should we expect?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Okay, this is Don. So domestic, we're seeing some improvements, and I'll just add that if you go look at our performance last year in the fourth quarter domestically, we were many, many points higher than everybody else in the fourth quarter. So to get some sequential improvement there, I think, is quite positive. We're expecting Atlantic and Pacific actually to perform in line with what we had in the third quarter, and we're seeing continued softness in Latin America.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And just if I might ask on the operating reliability again, Rob, I appreciate the color that you provided there on trying to fix it. The near-term improvement is encouraging, but it is off-season. So what gives you confidence as it's going to head into next summer that this continues? And are there some network changes that need to be made to address some of the issues?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: The confidence stems from a lot of work that's been done over the years is coming to fruition. So getting FAI, our Flight Attendant Integration, behind us I think is a big step. As we take a look at aircraft reliability as well, I do think that there are some things that we can do and are doing to make sure that we start the day off right, and that's really encouraging. And then as we take a look at network and schedule, there are always opportunities to rationalize fleets, to make routings more efficient, to make better use of reserves and spares. And so all that's under consideration. But when I take a look back over the course of the year, and yes, we're dealing with more of a shoulder season right now, but I do take a look at what we've done in really difficult operating conditions such as hurricanes and some really inclement weather here in DFW. I am impressed by the recovery that we've made and our ability to actually perform well in those conditions. So I'm encouraged. I see the results. As I take a look at the steady progression we made from 2014 to all the way through 2017 and then through the first quarter or so of 2018, I see us back on that kind of trend line that will show improvement going forward.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And I'm guessing that should drive some cost improvement. Is that reflected in that 1% to 2% guide then?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: It should drive cost improvement. It is within that guide of whether we do that, but we still haven't gone through the planning process. And as we go through the planning process, we'll see the adjustments that Robert's talking, whether it's from a schedule perspective or an operations perspective and build that into the 2019 budget.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, thank you.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, operator. Hi, guys. Thank you very much for taking the time, just one question here. What do you estimate your fuel recapture has been maybe year to date?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: I don't know if we've got that number, Derek? Let me just go ahead and then we'll \u2013 anyway, this is not a number that we actually calculate. But I can tell you having looked at I think what others do is, just how much have your earnings changed versus how much your fuel price has changed, which any of us can calculate. What you'll see is it's going to be a lower number than our two largest competitors, which is another way of saying how come your earnings have fallen more. Our fuel prices have gone up about the same amount as a percentage of expense. So the question if you're asking us why have your earnings fallen more, I'm just trying to get to the core cause. It's because our revenues haven't gone up as much. Our revenues are up, but not as up as much as those two airlines. A trend that we've been narrowing over time, as we talked on last quarter's call, we started to see that widen in 2018, a trend we don't like, a trend that we expect is going to reverse itself back in 2019. But anyway, there are separate stories for separate airlines. One of our large competitors had not their best year last year, so they're comparing to that, of course. When you look at us versus that airline on a two-year basis, we're still up on unit revenues versus that carrier. But anyway, so that's just a year-over-year comp issue. And then, but versus Delta, that's one that we've been narrowing nicely about for a couple of years in a row, has started to widen. But as we look at that, I think it's much what they are doing a better job than we can today of making sure this sell-up activity is available to the customers. They have products that are there where people buy, and they're available in channels that we don't have it available in yet. So we view that as upside. It's a big piece of our $1 billion of revenue initiatives is getting to the point where others have gotten and we just hadn't yet but will in 2019 in having those products available in more channels and easier to purchase. So we view that as upside. But anyway, Helane, when you look at it, getting as whatever the number is, you'll see its lower. However you calculate it, ours is going to be lower than those. And the reason is driven by our revenues not increasing at the same \u2013 our unit cost ex-fuel you saw was like less than 1% on some pretty small growth. So that's not the issue. It's just the relative revenue performance and the relative revenue performance as I described.\nHelane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Right, got you. And then just to follow-up on that. As you guys, I think, Derek, you said, and I know it's in the annual report. You talked about the large number of regional jets that are coming in next year. So, as we think about your gauge for next year, how should we think about that relative to, I guess, revenue because gauge comes down next year or goes up?\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Part of what's going on next year is our reconfiguration project. So, the gauge should actually go up next year a little bit as we bring on the aircraft, as we modify the 321s and the 73s. And from a regional perspective, the gauge should go up also. So, in both cases, I would expect gauge to be a positive next year, which as you know is positive growth for us. I think it could be around 1% of gauge as we take the mainline and regional combined next year.\nHelane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, great, thanks very much, guys.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Crissey from Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nKevin Crissey - Citi: Hey, thanks for the time.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Sure.\nKevin Crissey - Citi: I'm not sure who is best positioned to answer this, but when you benchmark American's cost structure and efficiency metrics against your peers, what areas present the biggest opportunities aside from maybe the Dallas/Fort Worth that you noted?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: I'll start, Kevin, and the team can chime in. Versus our peers, again, our stage-length adjusted cost structure American versus our two largest competitors looks all-in-all reasonably close indeed if not around top of each other. But nonetheless we do think we have primarily due to the merger still some costs that we can reduce which is a big piece of this \u2013 again, the operational integration getting completed, that's $300 million we talk about. So, that's the biggest thing that we have that they don't. There are differences between carriers. We have higher ownership costs, because we have new aircraft. They have higher fuel and maintenance costs because they have older airplanes things like that. But when you add it all up, our costs per ASM on a stage-adjusted basis for the three airlines all look awfully similar at this point in time.\nKevin Crissey - Citi: Okay, thanks. And when we think about the specials, they're still a significant number. And I know you've had obviously the merger and you had the fleet restructuring, but it's a large number and it's been a large number for quite a while. How should we think about that? And I know you can't necessarily predict it, but it's a relatively consistently large number. Is that something that we should think about going away over time because you're running at kind of $0.5 billion to $1 billion a year?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah. Look, absolutely, you should think of it is going away, because it should. But I just note that they're real numbers of course. And we did just do this large operations integration that Robert talked about that took all sorts of training for if I sensed it would not have happened had we not done a merger. So, it's right and appropriate to pull it out as a special expense and yeah, it's nearly five years later, but that's when it happened. So that number should now continue to come down certainly the merger related. We like other airlines to the extent there are fleet restructurings and things like that to continue which we don't anticipate. But we think it's always right for the benefit of our investors to point out those that feel like one-time events versus recurring events. So, hard to predict what those will be over time, but the merger-related expenses, absolutely, you'll see continue to go down and it should go away over the next couple of years.\nKevin Crissey - Citi: Thank you.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, Doug, I just want to come back to your response to Helane there on your relative underperformance this year. I guess, what are the concrete steps as you look into 2019 that you're taking to correct the relative underperformance in revenue and margins between your bigger peers here or your biggest peers?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Okay, again, and we're going to have others chime in. The biggest things in that, in the $1 billion of revenue initiatives are product segmentation, which again for the most part is Basic Economy and Premium Economy, but also having the ability to sell those in more channels and more easily to our customers. And again that's execution against initiatives that we have underway, and again not reinventing any wheel here. Those are areas that other carriers have that we just don't have yet, but we'll have into 2019. The fleet reconfiguration, the harmonization of our fleet that continues and will be largely in place in 2019 is a good piece of that number, which we weren't able to do in 2018 as we didn't have the fleet reconfigure. And this international network restructuring that we keep talking about, that where we were flying some flights internationally at some pretty large losses like our Chicago to China routes that we've relocated. And then there's just all sorts of other smaller type initiatives, they add up to reasonably large numbers. That again, some of those are just getting a little catch-up because of what \u2013 as we've been going through our merger and other airlines had more time than we have. We get to items like, denied boarding, auction process being better automated than we have today. So, a number of initiatives that we look at. Again, none of these things are taking share away from someone else, because we think our products going to be a whole lot better even though we do. It's all about being sure that the existing demand or the existing demand grown naturally is producing higher unit revenue because we're doing a better job of executing against those plans.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And, I guess, is there a lot of urgency in the organization to drive higher profitability, is that a top priority for the team?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yes, Brandon. And again, as I said in my comments, look, the fact that we're confident, please don't take as indifference. We have a huge performance-based culture around here. We have people very fired up. We certainly don't like seeing our earnings fall more than others, but we know why it is, we know what we need to do, we're highly confident, we have the right plans, right people in place and that's why we're confident in saying things like you're going to see the revenue outperformance that we like in 2019. You're going to see earnings improve in 2019 because we are focused on that.\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: I'd just add, the confidence also comes just knowing that this is going to happen. So, when Doug talks about Premium Economy, we know that by the end of this year we will have our 777s completed. We know that by next summer, we will have our 787 fleet done. We know that by next summer that we're on track to have 50% of our 737 reconfigurations done. Those are things that we absolutely know. We know that with the changes we've made in terms of network are now coming to fruition. While we talk about changes that we've made to Brazil, and we talk about changes that we've made to China, those are now just being put into the schedule. And then, as we take a look forward and again, numbers that we haven't included in that $1 billion, we know that those gates are going to come online. Those are on track. And so, the confidence here is rooted in really things that we're going to be executing on and we know they're on track.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I appreciate it, that should be good for the stock if that works.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Brandon. We agree.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hey, Dan.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. The multi-year CapEx outlook is very helpful. Doug, on the past call you offered a multi-year roadmap on debt and leverage. And I think the expectation was that leverage will begin to fall in 2019. Since then fuel -we've had higher fuel, margins have contracted. So, I'm hoping you or Derek could once again update us on the thought process here for leveraging each of the coming three years. Does it need to go higher before it begins to fall in 2020 and 2021?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Let me give you a generic answer, then Derek can provide any mathematical details he cares to provide. So, look, anyway, the issue on the debt is as follows. I mean, again, Derek to give you some estimates, I think, on what's happened already it is. We are indeed reducing somewhat, but yeah, earnings matter in any projections of course. But, to the extent of what we just described is accurate and we believe it is that is earnings improvement and CapEx declines what you should see is a natural de-levering, because, again, we didn't go at debt because we were trying to get some optimum debt level. We went net of debt because we were adding a lot of assets. And the best way to fund those assets was through some really efficient debt. And we thought and continue to believe that was in our shareholders' best interest. So, as you move forward, and there isn't a need to continue to do aircraft transactions, you should expect us to pay off debt as it comes due and there's substantial amount that comes due in the next few years. Pay it off as it comes due. There's nothing we're going to go pay off in advance. It's all incredibly efficient debt, but as it comes due we'll pay it off and we won't replace it. So, we should expect a natural de-levering as we move forward with higher profitability and lower CapEx needs.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Don, Latin America has been very volatile absent a JV in the near to medium term. How do you solve for the shortfall versus peak revenue in the region? Are you seeing demand trends beginning to inflect and how long is it going to take to dig on the revenue hole there?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Okay. First of all, I know we talk about Latin. We often think about different piece of Latin, but Latin is a complicated part of business. So, Caribbean, Central America kind of Northern Rim markets excluding Venezuela have actually performed pretty well. The weakness that we've seen has been in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. And as we look forward into Brazil, we're taking capacity actions. We reduced capacity by 10% in September-October. And we're reducing capacity by 20% going forward in Brazil. Mexico, we've seen a very tough environment there, particularly the pricing driven by capacity increases and some concerns probably over travel warnings. But as we look forward into the fourth quarter, we're seeing demand come back a bit. We mentioned in the call last year, we have a number of initiatives in the RM and sales space around kind of real off-peak load factor performance, and we're seeing some real improvements in the load factors in Mexico, as we look forward although the yield environment remains weak. So, overall, Latin America, we were down, in a revenue perspective, 1.6%. Parts of it are doing really well, parts of it that aren't doing well. And where we're not doing well we're focused on capacity and our load factor performance.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, thanks for the timing, guys.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Our question is from Andrew Tangel from The Wall Street Journal. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal: Hey. Good morning. How are you?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Well. How are you?\nAndrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal: Hey, you indicated that American has lagged United and Delta on upselling and offering premium products to customers that tap into the higher potential revenue. Could you give us a better idea of why that is, what the holdup has been, and where else in your judgment you've not been fast enough to increase revenue?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: I'll let Don do that and having again, it's not like we haven't acted fast enough. The reality is this. We've been in the middle of an integration. We have all sorts of needs. So, I don't want to make it sound like anyone here hasn't been proactively working to get all sorts of things done. We do find ourselves today in a position where we are working on some initiatives that aren't yet complete that will allow us to do better than we are today. Go ahead Don and where we are versus others.\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: We've actually done a pretty good job of growing our ancillary revenue streams. In the third quarter, ancillary revenues are up 18%. We re-launched our Main Cabin extra product in June. And since we've done that we've seen unit revenues for Main Cabin extra grow at 24%, but we see that we actually have more opportunity beyond that. And the big opportunity for us is, we haven't yet built out our infrastructure to be able to push offers out to customers effectively between time of booking and time of check-in. And that's a big window where we can put and so many offers in front of our customers to increase of ancillary revenue stream even more than we've been able to go do it and that's really an IT infrastructure question. We have a project underway. We expect to be able to be more effective in doing that in 2019.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Correct me if I'm wrong, Don. But particularly, bookings that are made outside of aa.com...\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: In third-party channels as well.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: ...in third-party channels, Andrew, others have more ability to push out offers to their customers that are main third-party channels than we do today, but we'll get that corrected.\nAndrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal: Okay. If I can one follow-up. This year, United has embarked on a growth plan, the regional flying with midcontinent hubs. How much market share have you lost to United as part of that? And how much of a threat or has that growth plan proven to American so far this year?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Well, again, first off, I don't know that we can like particularly say versus that. We certainly haven't seen any discernible market share shift. Probably the best way to answer that which I'll let Don do is, if to the extent we're seeing it versus anybody else would see it be in Chicago and just talk about how, what we're seeing in Chicago on a year-over-year basis.\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: So the biggest overlap we have is in Chicago, but we flew our largest scheduled departure at Chicago that we've ever flown this summer. And as we look at our performance in Chicago, it was our highest year-over-year unit revenue producing hub. On the corporate side, our corporate revenue in Chicago is up 15%. Our share gap, the way we measure our corporate market share relative to our capacity, is actually up by 0.5 point, so that's also positive. We haven't lost a single corporate account in Chicago. So we feel pretty good about the way customers have stuck with us this year.\nAndrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal: All right, thanks.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Conor Shine from Dallas Morning News. Your line is now open.\nConor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Good morning, guys.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hi.\nConor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: I was just hoping to get a little bit of any color you guys can provide in terms of where you guys are in the employee restructuring. You guys announced earlier this summer, mostly targeted upper management. Has that been completed? Is there any sense of scale in terms of number of positions impacted or dollar figure that you guys could share on that?\nElise R. Eberwein - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah, Conor. It's Elise. We're really pleased with how it went this past summer. Out of about 550 director and above employees, we had an uptake of about 100, which was higher than our expectation. And we're happy for those people who elected to move on but even happier with the people who renewed their vows and elected to stay. We're in the process of working through the rest of the levels now, and we're seeing good results there too. So stay tuned for more.\nConor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: When you say levels, have you gotten below the director level at this point in time?\nElise R. Eberwein - American Airlines Group, Inc.: We're still working through that.\nConor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.: Okay, thank you.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Conor.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Koenig from The Associated Press. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hi, David.\nDavid Koenig - The Associated Press: Good morning, folks. Most of my questions were asked and answered, but I did want to know. I think maybe Derek was looking for a figure when Doug was answering Helane Becker's question. Was there, first of all, ever a figure on how much fuel cost increase you are recapturing with fares and fees?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: We don't have that number, I guess. Anyway, you can get it from analysts. Go ahead, Derek.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: It's 40%.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah. 40%, thanks.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Calculated the same way that Delta and United have calculated.\nDavid Koenig - The Associated Press: 40%, okay. Thank you. And on the 1.5% to 3.5% TRASM guide for 4Q, how much would that be if you took out cargo and credit card and stuff like that? How much would the PRASM part of it be?\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: We actually just don't look at it that way. These things are all really interrelated. And so we focus on our TRASM number.\nDavid Koenig - The Associated Press: Okay, all right. Thanks.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is now open.\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: Hi, good morning. I had a question just about labor in general. If you could, just give us an update on what's going on with the mechanics. You have pilot negotiations, I think, coming up soon. Also, there have been a bunch of protests with some of the regional employees too, and you gave a pay raise I think it was like a year and a half ago that you've first announced it. Is it possible to give further pay increases to your employees going forward?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: I'll do an overview, and then Steve can fill in any blanks if there are any.\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: Thanks.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thank you, Leslie. So on our fleet service and mechanics, the IAM-TWU partnership \u2013 association I should say, negotiations, as soon as those contracts became amendable, the company asked that we go to the National Mediation Board for assistance. We just haven't been able, despite everyone's best efforts, to get that contract closed up. And we think it makes sense for the National Mediation Board to bring us there to get us there. So that's done. That we think is a very positive development. So it's now in the hands of the National Mediation Board to actually oversee those negotiations, and that will begin shortly. So hopefully that will bring us to the conclusion that we weren't able to get done with the parties themselves. We do have, at the end of 2019, our flight attendant and pilot contracts become amendable, so we'll open those negotiation sometime in 2019. Those are five-year contracts that we've signed five years ago. So that's where it stands. All in all though, what I'll tell you is, the team is doing a great job. The leadership team has done a really nice job of taking care of our team and is making a huge difference in the way that our team is now taking care of our customers. And we're really happy with the way all that is done, and we hope to get these negotiations all completed as they come due.\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: And is it possible to get some of the workers will get an increase in pay? I know that there are some outside the mechanics and...\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: I'm sorry, are you asking about the regional carriers? Steve on the wholly-owned subsidiaries?\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: Yeah.\nStephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Sure, we have several negotiations going on with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. But the two leading ones are the negotiations with our ground employees at Envoy and Piedmont. One of those has been agreed with the union and is out for ratification now. The second of those, I would expect to be concluded as soon as the first ratifies. And there are pretty big pay increases built into those, the tentative agreement for the first and what we have on the table for the second.\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: Thank you.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Biers from AFP. Your line is now open.\nJohn Biers - Agence-France Presse: Thanks very much for taking the question. This has come up in the other calls as well, but the strength of corporate traveling has been a positive for the airline industry of late. Do you think the growth in that area is sustainable? Are we peaking? Has it peaked? What's your sense there? And are you seeing any kind of breakout, is corporate travel stronger within the U.S. domestically, or is it also very strong overseas?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Okay, this is Don Casey. Corporate travel has been very strong this year. It's been broad-based. It's been across really all of the industrial areas that we focus on. The early indicators for next year based on surveys that other bodies do is that the expectation is that corporate traffic will remain strong into next year and that it will likely grow.\nStephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.: And, Don, I'd add just add too. As we take a look going forward, I know that we see opportunities in continuing to engage with small and medium-sized businesses. We have an AAirpass program that really appeals to really very small accounts, and we see great traction there. So there's continued opportunity for us to expand how we connect with businesses, especially smaller businesses.\nJohn Biers - Agence-France Presse: Thanks.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is now open.\nMary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP: Close again. Hey, I just needed to clarify two things please. On the fuel cost recapture, was the timeframe on that third quarter or year to date, the 40%?\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: That's year to date.\nMary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP: Okay, great.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: That's year to date.\nMary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP: Thank you. And, Elise, on the buyouts or whatever you all are calling them, do you expect those to go below management levels? Will we see any like front-line employees at that level affected?\nElise R. Eberwein - American Airlines Group, Inc.: No, Mary. This was an exercise to go through post-integration and look at our management head count and make a reduction of roughly 5%, Derek.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yes. And, Mary, sorry about that. That's just third quarter. The 40% is just the third quarter recapture, not full year.\nMary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP: Okay.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Not year to date, just third quarter.\nMary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP: Great, thank you.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Mary.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tracy Rucinski from Reuters. Your line is now open. Tracy, your line is now open. And our next question is from Ted Reed from Forbes. Your line is now open.\nTed Reed - Forbes Media LLC: Hey, thank you. Hi, thank you. My question is for Robert. I know you're working hard now to improve operations, but your operations seem to be in leadership a couple years ago and they since seemed to have deteriorated. Why have your operations been deteriorating the past couple years? Is it just weather, or is it something more?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: No, Ted. First off, I'd just go back and we've been at merging the airline, integrating a lot of different areas over the past number of years. But as I said in my comments, in terms of our core operating reliability, but for the really major events, we've been pleased with modest continued improvement in those things that are really important to our customers and drive customer satisfaction and likelihood to recommend scores. And again, as we took a look into this year, we've been making steady progress and then springtime summer we fell off. We think there are some reasons behind it, a lot of additional work, some other one-time issues. But at the end of the day, we need to do a better job of making sure that we're prepared for peak season that we have aircraft available first thing in the morning and that we do a good job of turning them throughout the day. Those are basics, we're good at that. I know that as we progress through the summer and really have everybody take a look at what went on, we'll get back to the track that we were on. And so, I look at this as more of a blip and something that as I look into 2019, will be certainly more of a strength and an opportunity for efficiency and improvement to the P&L. So, upside for us.\nTed Reed - Forbes Media LLC: All right. I just don't have a clear sense of why it fell off.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Well, so, I'd point to a few things. Certainly, inclement weather is something that is always an issue, but that's not a focus area. At the start of the summer, we had a lot of extra work, inspecting 600-and-some-odd CFM 56-7 engines, fan blades that hadn't been expected. We had an inordinate number of engine changes with some of the newer aircraft deliveries that we're working with the aircraft manufacturers on making sure that we get a fix for that in the long run. And then I'd say that on some of the fleets that we're retiring our super 80 fleet that was something that it took a little bit more work than we had anticipated. But you put all that together and no excuses, that's something that we can plan for and do better and we have. And we are and we have and we'll make sure that we cover as we get into, peak season is coming up.\nTed Reed - Forbes Media LLC: All right. Thank you, I appreciate it.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Ted.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. Your line is now open.\nRobert Silk - Travel Weekly: Thank you. So, you all mentioned that commission payout that sort of flattened this year, but there were big jumps last year like more than 30% and you're still up about 8%, I think, through the first half of this year on commission payments, and you're not alone in doing in that. What in general has driven just the higher commission payouts across the industry?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: This is Doug. And as Don said, it's competitive. So, anyway, it's a competitive business and there are really three of us that compete mostly in this. And if someone decides they want to really go after the business and do it through higher commissions, we need to be competitive. So that's what's been happening. And as we've seen other carriers in an effort to win back some business they've lost lower commissions, and we need to compete for that. I expect as you see things normalize that'll change.\nRobert Silk - Travel Weekly: Is there been any sort of \u2013 as you all concentrate more on segmentation and on driving process in the front of the plane, has there been any sort of recognition that's driven the desire to reward agencies more the deal with these high-end customers?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: No. Clearly, we're all focused on high value customers, right, and customers they're going to pay higher fares on average. And a lot of our activity in our sales organization is really B2B activity, focused on corporate customers and agencies that drive a lot of that business. And that revenue is growing, as I said, at a very, very strong pace right now.\nRobert Silk - Travel Weekly: Thanks, guys.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Robert.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Excellent. All right. Thanks everybody for your interest and we appreciate it. Bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.\nDaniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Shannon, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to the American Airlines Group second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Finance Officer. Also in the room for the Q&A session are several of our senior execs, including Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management. We're going to start the call this morning with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the second quarter, provide some additional information on guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on our operational performance and revenue environment. And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call to analysts' questions, and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and cost, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans, and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit, and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, and that can be found on our website at aa.com. The webcast of this will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on today's call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us. At this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thank you, Dan. Good morning, and thanks for joining us, everyone. This has been a challenging quarter for American Airlines. In fact it's probably the most challenging quarter we've faced since our merger in 2013. First and foremost, the computer outage at PSA in June was extremely disruptive to our team and our customers. Our team members did heroic things to address that issue and take care of our customers, but we regret the inconvenience that we caused for so many. In addition, higher fuel prices have materially reduced our earnings. The increase in fuel price alone drove our second quarter 2018 expenses up by over $700 million, which led to a $593 million decline in year-over-year pre-tax earnings excluding special items. And our passenger revenues, while still growing, trailed the growth rates of our two largest competitors. This occurred for the first time since 2016 in the first quarter of this year, but it widened in the second quarter. And if everybody's forecasts are accurate, it's projected to widen in the third quarter as well. Now, a lot of that shift is explained by entity mix, specifically relative weakness in Latin America and by more difficult comparisons versus last year. But some of it's underperformance in the United States, which is a cause of concern for us. As a result of these trends, we lowered our 2018 EPS estimate to between $4.50 and $5.00 per share versus $5.27 in 2017. This decline in earnings has some in the investment community questioning our ability to again achieve our target annual pre-tax earnings of $5 billion within the foreseeable future. The question we generally get is, look 2018 is a pretty good year economically, yet we have the earning only approximately $3 billion pre-tax in 2018, so do you still believe American is an airline that can produce profits averaging $5 billion per year? The answer to that question every time is, of course we do. Our projected 2018 fuel expense would be over $2 billion lower if prices had simply stayed at 2017 levels. And we earned a little over $4 billion pre-tax in 2017. Had fuel prices not run up so far, so quickly, we firmly believe that 2018 would have been a year where we again produced $5 billion in pre-tax earnings. The solitary fact that fuel costs have risen, and the impact of that increase has not been offset immediately doesn't alter our view about the steady state earnings potential of American Airlines. But fuel prices have in fact risen, and importantly they've held at these elevated levels for several months now. To the extent any of us were viewing this quick run-up as a spike that would quickly correct itself, we should abandon that notion. We at American are assuming that $75 a barrel Brent crude or higher is our new reality, and we intend to adapt our airline to one that can make $5 billion per year at these fuel prices. The fact is there are many activities that make sense at $45 a barrel of oil, which no longer make sense at $75 per barrel. We're taking aggressive actions in the immediate term, including lowering our 2018 capacity growth, reducing our non-fuel expenses, and deferring future aircraft deliveries and CapEx. We're also adjusting our Basic Economy product offering to become more competitive. Robert and Derek will describe those actions in more detail shortly. We also feel very good about our plans moving into 2019. We anticipate American will continue to grow at a rate lower than any other U.S. airline, despite the fact we have what we believe are the industry's best growth prospects. In 2019, American will acquire 15 more gates in Dallas-Fort Worth and seven more gates in Charlotte, North Carolina, which are our two most profitable hubs. And of course, we still have the upside of the strategic initiatives we discussed at our Investor and Media Day last September. As a result of these actions, we are confident American will return to both revenue outperformance and earnings growth in 2019 and beyond. And most importantly, we are excited about the long-term future of American and the airline we're building. We remain absolutely committed to our efforts to build a better and more competitive American and increasing shareholder value over the longer term. We're creating a world-class customer experience by continuing our extensive investment in improving our product with the youngest fleet among the largest U.S. carriers, industry-leading high-speed satellite Wi-Fi, best-in-class Admirals Club and Flagship Lounges, investments in our airports, including our upcoming expansion at DFW and Charlotte, and the reimagining of our terminal space at LAX and O'Hare. We are expanding our network intelligently, while also pursuing regulatory approvals for our joint business agreements with our partners at Qantas, LATAM, and Aer Lingus. We're making our culture a competitive advantage by dramatically sharpening our focus on leadership, communication, training, inclusion and diversity, and creating an environment that cares for our frontline team members. And we're working to ensure the long-term financial strength of American by smartly maximizing our network, optimizing our fleet, and improving our revenue performance by harmonizing our fleet configurations and through further cabin segmentation. We continue to maximize the value of the world's leading branded credit card, the AAdvantage Mastercard, through innovation such as our new no fee AAdvantage card, which just launched two weeks ago. As a result, we remain on track to deliver on the strategic initiatives, driving $2.9 billion of revenue expansion and $1 billion of cost improvements that we committed to at our Investor Day presentation in September. And because of all that, and primarily because of the amazing team we have at American, we are very bullish on the future of American Airlines. That said, I'll turn it over to Derek, who will be followed by Robert, and then Q&A. Derek?\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our team members who are doing a great job taking care of our customers during this busy summer period. Their hard work and positive attitude continues to be fundamentally important to our success. We filed our second quarter earnings press release and 10-Q this morning. The significant increase in fuel price led to lower year-over-year earnings. Excluding net special items, we reported a net profit of $757 million in 2018 versus our 2017 net profit of $1 billion. Our diluted earnings per share excluding net special items in the second quarter of 2018 was $1.63 per share, beating consensus of $1.59 per share. Excluding net special items, our second quarter pre-tax profit was $1 billion, with a pre-tax margin of 8.6%. Our total operating revenues, which were up 3.7% to $11.6 billion were a record for any quarter in American Airlines' history. This was also the seventh consecutive quarter in which we achieved positive unit revenue growth, with total revenue per ASM up 2.1%. Passenger revenues were up 3.1% to $10.7 billion, driven in part by a 1% improvement in yields. Our cargo team continues to produce great results. In the second quarter, a 9.6% increase in volumes and a 8.9% increase in yields, drove a 19.4% increase in cargo revenues to $261 million. For the full year, we are forecasting revenue growth in the cargo business of 13%, and anticipate that cargo revenues will break the $1 billion mark for the first time in the company's history. Meanwhile, other revenues were up 8.1%, driven primarily by continued improvement in our loyalty program. Total operating expenses were $10.6 billion, up 10.3%. The primary driver of this increase was consolidated fuel expense, which was $729 million or 40% higher year-over-year. As a result, consolidated cost per ASM was up 8.5% year over year. We continue to focus on our non-fuel cost performance during the quarter. Our consolidated CASM excluding fuel and special items was up 2.4% year-over-year, more than 1 point lower than the midpoint of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the quarter, driven by improved team member productivity, lower maintenance costs, and higher than anticipated airport rent settlement credits. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $7.2 billion in total available liquidity. During the quarter, we completed a number of transactions including paying off a $500 million unsecured note and repricing an extension of the $1.8 billion South American credit facility. The company also returned $396 million to shareholders in the form of a dividend payment of $46 million and by repurchasing 8.2 million shares at a cost of $350 million. In addition, the company made $158 million contribution to its defined benefit pension plans. As we have discussed previously on calls, now that our fleet renewal program is winding down, we have begun to reduce our debt levels. Since the beginning of the year, our adjusted total debt, which includes our pension obligations has decreased by $1.3 billion, and we anticipate that it will continue to decline from this level each year. We filed our investor update this morning, which includes our guidance for the remainder of the year. In that guidance, we updated our capacity plans and reduced our 2018 full-year forecast by 50 basis points. This reduction is driven by a 60 basis point reduction in the third quarter, with the fourth quarter 100 basis points lower than previous guidance. These changes are the result of our ongoing analysis of the impact of higher fuel on the profitability of our network, which has led to the elimination of underperforming flying in the second half of the year. While we are still in the process of building our 2019 level of operations, we expect our capacity growth to be the lowest of any major carrier, and to be at or below GDP. This growth will be driven by gauge increases and a one-time opportunity to increase flying from our two most profitable hubs, with the additional gates in Dallas and Charlotte starting to come online next year. We continue to examine our fleet plans with a view to better align our delivery stream with the needs of the airline, and our expectations for growth of our network. During the quarter, we reached an agreement to defer \u2013 with Airbus to defer delivery of 22 A321neos that were scheduled to arrive between 2019 and 2021. This change will reduce our overall aircraft CapEx by $1.2 billion over the next three years. We will now begin to take delivery of these aircraft in 2024. We also announced a large regional jet order for 30 new aircraft to replace smaller regional jets. 29 of these will be delivered in 2019, with the last scheduled to be received in early 2020. As a result of these changes, we are revising our aircraft CapEx guidance. For 2018, we continue to expect aircraft CapEx of $1.9 billion, and we now expect our new aircraft CapEx for 2019 to be $2.9 billion, that's up slightly due to large regional jet order, offset by the A321 deferrals. 2020 aircraft CapEx will be reduced by $500 million to $1.2 billion and 2021 will be reduced by $400 million to $1 billion. As we look at our year-to-date results, we are happy with our progress on the revenue and cost initiatives we outlined at our Investor Day last fall. However, given the higher fuel prices, we have to do more to get back on the path to grow margins. We have been driving forward on our One Airline initiative, a company-wide project to realize the benefits of the merger and create a more lean and efficient company. We have identified opportunities in a number of diverse areas to drive cost down throughout the business, including the insourcing of regional affiliate flying to our lower-cost wholly-owned regional partners, conducting health plan audits with a focus on lowering pharmaceutical expenses, reducing non-front-line management expenses we structure our organization for the future, and lower staffing requirements associated with the changes to our Basic Economy product. This project continues to identify new opportunities and we now expect $300 million of cost savings in 2018, and more than $1 billion over the next four years. Due to the success of our One Airline project and the efficiencies we have been able to achieve during the year, we lowered our full-year CASM guidance this morning, even after the reduction in capacity I outlined earlier. We now anticipate that our unit cost growth rate excluding fuel and special items will be approximately 1.5% for 2018. It'll be approximately 1% in the third quarter and approximately flat in the fourth quarter. With the majority of our integration work complete, it is imperative that we continue this momentum to drive costs lower in our business. Fuel continues to be higher on a year-over-year basis. Based on the forward curve as of July 18, we are forecasting a 30.4% increase in consolidated fuel expense in 2018, which will be an increase of $2.3 billion. For the full year, we now anticipate our fuel price to be between $2.18 to $2.23 per gallon. We also guided to a third quarter 2018 TRASM increase of 1% to 3%, and Robert will provide more detail on that, and what we're seeing in the revenue environment. Taking this revenue and cost guidance together, we expect our third quarter of 2018 pre-tax margin excluding net special items to be between 5% and 7%, and our 2018 earnings per diluted share guide to be between $4.50 and $5 a share. In conclusion, I would like to once again thank our entire team for doing their hard work. Our emphasis on managing cost in this business will continue with a focus on getting back to growing margins, which we believe will happen in 2019. With that I will turn the call over to Robert.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Derek. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I begin my remarks, I too would like to thank our team for their efforts in the quarter. They worked through some challenging weather conditions, which at times were really tough on the operation, and in addition we experienced a technology outage at one of our three wholly-owned regional carriers, PSA. The impact unfortunately resulted in the cancelation of approximately 3,000 flights the following week. During the week, our team worked all hours of the day and night to rebook, refund, re-protect our customers, and they also worked tirelessly to recover crew member schedules and return the operation to normalcy. We can't thank our team enough for managing through the start of the summer and this event, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for inconveniencing them, especially during the summer travel season. Going forward, we're further hardening our systems and ensuring that our team is equipped to recover more quickly no matter what comes our way. As both Doug and Derek mentioned in their remarks, persistently high fuel prices negatively impacted our second quarter results. We continue to be extremely confident in our long-term prospects and are committed to taking actions necessary to improve our short-term financial performance. Although we have delivered positive unit revenue growth for the last seven quarters and eight quarters in a row of outperformance versus the industry, the reality is that we must do more to offset higher fuel prices and grow earnings. We are taking decisive action. As Derek mentioned in his remarks, we have moderated our future capacity plans, deferred aircraft deliveries, made further reductions to our planned capital expenditures, and lowered our cost outlook. These are necessary and beneficial steps to take in light of the current fuel price environment. During the second quarter, we continued to make progress on the $2.9 billion of revenue and $1 billion of cost initiatives that we outlined at our Media and Investor Day last fall. As a reminder, as part of that plan, we said that we would take advantage of the power of our hubs and gateways, strengthen our domestic network, and grow where we have a competitive advantage. We are pleased with our progress on these network initiatives. We continue to play to our strengths, which means growing at our hubs. Any new flight we add to these hubs grows connecting revenue opportunities exponentially. During the second quarter, we launched 43 new non-stop routes and seven new stations. We added new markets like Missoula, Montana out of our hubs in DFW and Chicago O'Hare, as well as Panama City Beach, Florida from our hubs in Charlotte and DFW. In addition to creating new flight options for our customers, this growth brings high-margin, high-quality revenue on to our network. It also creates more connecting opportunities for our customers, facilitating new international destinations, like the addition of new seasonal service from DFW to Reykjavik, Philadelphia to Prague and Budapest, and between Chicago and Venice. The early results from these recent changes are encouraging, as all of our domestic network adds to DFW have produced margins that are in excess of our system average. We grew ASMs at DFW by 4% during the second quarter and RASM grew even more at 4.4%. As we look forward into 2019, we will continue to grow from our most profitable hubs with a primary focus on high quality growth from the 15 new gates at Dallas-Fort Worth and the seven new gates at our Charlotte hub, as well as the five new gates at Chicago O'Hare that opened earlier this year. We expect that some of that additional growth will be funded by moving less profitable flying from other parts of our network. Our co-brand portfolio continues to see very strong acquisition growth year over year, with lower-than-expected attrition and continued growth in card spend. We are excited about the enhanced benefits we recently announced for our Citi/AAdvantage Platinum Select card in May and the introduction of a new no fee co-brand card to our portfolio this month, the AAdvantage MileUp card. We expect that these additions to our portfolio to build on our already strong acquisition retention and card spend performance and ensure an AAdvantage co-brand card as the primary card for even more of our customers. The corporate demand environment remains strong, as our sales initiatives continue to drive results. We ended June with another positive quarter with corporate revenue growth of 10% and continued improvement in our share gap. Forward performance remains positive. In addition, the sales team has built a healthy corporate pipeline, signing new agreements with key accounts, and our small to medium sized corporate acquisitions are at an all-time high. We continue to see impressive results from our highly differentiated Premium Economy product, which is now installed on 87 wide-body aircraft. Premium Economy is now being sold on 67 routes at an average fare that continues to be double the coach cabin fare. We currently estimate that the Premium Economy retrofit program will be complete by the summer of 2019, and at that time we will have 124 aircraft with Premium Economy. While we have been happy with the rollout of our Basic Economy product over the last year, we announced today that beginning September 5, American will remove the carry-on bag restriction that is currently part of our domestic and short-haul international Basic Economy fare rules. Basic Economy is working well in the markets where we offer it, and we continue to see more than 60% of our customers buy up to Main Cabin when offered a choice. But the carry-on bag restriction left us uncompetitive from a product attribute perspective in some markets, and total incremental revenue from Basic Economy has fallen short of our original expectations. Removing the bag restriction will make this product more competitive, allowing us to offer this low fare product to more customers. Network wide Basic Economy remains central to our plans, and during the second quarter, we expanded it across the entire Atlantic network. Results in this region have been very encouraging, with strong conversion rates to our Main Cabin product in excess of 60%. And even more importantly, we are offering the product choice to over 80% of our coach customers. Turning to revenue. Our second quarter revenue was up 3.7% year-over-year and was an all-time record for any quarter at $11.6 billion. Second quarter cargo revenue improved 19.4% year-over-year on both strong volume and yields, continuing the positive trend we've seen since the second half of 2016. Our other revenue was up 8.1%, driven by increased revenues in our loyalty program due to strong co-brand credit card acquisitions and cardholder spend driving higher mileage sales. Overall, TRASM improved 2.1% year-over-year. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter with positive unit revenue growth. International was particularly strong, but every entity had positive unit revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter. Domestic unit revenue was up 0.3%, driven by a 1 point increase in load factor. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth for the domestic entity, although we did see some drag due to the Basic Economy competitiveness issues during the quarter. Atlantic unit revenue was up 6.2%, driven by strong yield performance due to premium cabin demand, Premium Economy and the introduction of Basic Economy during the quarter. Our Latin America performance was also strong with PRASM up 4.6%, with strength across the board, with the exception of Mexico pleasure markets. Pacific PRASM was up 3.6% year-over-year on the basis of improved premium cabin performance. Japan and Korea were our strongest markets year-over-year. Looking forward, we see core airline revenue performance improving as demand for our product remains strong. However, we do have some unique headwinds that will affect American quarter to quarter. In particular, we expect softening in Brazil and Argentina to negatively impact third quarter unit revenue by approximately 0.5 point. In spite of a less favorable entity mix, we still expect our year-over-year TRASM to be up 1% to 3% in the third quarter with Atlantic and domestic improving, and Pacific similar to the second quarter. This will be our eighth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth. And we remain bullish about the future because of the actions we will take to improve profitability. To address underperforming entities and drive overall yields, we are reducing our planned capacity growth, with reductions in China, Brazil, and across our network. We are also deferring aircraft, reducing our planned capital expenditures, and lowering our cost outlook. We will be completing the integration of our flight attendant workforce later this year, which will enable the unrestricted deployment of our fleet across the network. In addition, we still have the majority of our revenue initiatives that will come online through 2021 and more than $1 billion in cost saving initiatives over that same period, and this does not include the benefit from being able to re-deploy aircraft and to expand to our two largest and most profitable hubs in 2019 and beyond. As we finish up the summer travel period, we continue to be encouraged by the economic environment and strength we see in passenger demand. While we remain focused on the long term, we will continue to make investments that grow revenue, drive efficiencies, and expect to be on the path to margin expansion in 2019. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and to begin our question-and-answer session. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Doug, can you just talk about the balance sheet in this environment? I know cyclically the economy is doing well here, but obviously, you guys have the most leverage of all your peers, and I think that's added some pressure for the equity holders. So, can you talk about the way you view the balance sheet going forward?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Sure. We think it's good for our equity holders, our capital structure strategy. But \u2013 look, as it relates to the debt, the first thing we always should note is we have much higher asset values, given our much younger fleet than our larger competitors. Just kind of desktop appraisals of our aircraft are around $30 billion. I think those other guys around $15 billion. So, there's a huge asset value. That doesn't explain it all. Our debt levels are more than just that asset value, but please don't ignore that piece. But look, what we believe, and the other point worth making by the way is that we hold very large amounts of cash because \u2013 as protection for what seems like the reason people would suggest we should be less levered, that is, in the risk of something \u2013 for risk protection. So, we choose to, instead of having more equity, which is a lot more expensive than debt, we choose to have more debt than others. We think it's \u2013 we think it's exactly \u2013 it's a very prudent level. We're not concerned about the levels, particularly given the asset values. And we protect ourselves by holding a lot more cash than companies of our size generally do. And we think that's the right capital structure for our investors. It absolutely and \u2013 what leverage does, is when earnings decline, it has a bigger effect and those are more levered when earnings increase, we get more of the bump. That's not why we do it, but that certainly is one of the effects. But what we really try and do is make sure that our total capital structure is right for American Airlines and for our investors. And we don't think delevering, and therefore, getting even more equity, which is much more expensive than the debt, makes sense for our investors.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate that insight. And then Robert, on your domestic PRASM, when we look across the industry, it does appear that some of your bigger competitors might be seeing some acceleration in revenue, so we're just wondering, what is the difference between American's network and maybe what some of your peers are seeing in the market? And I think you talked about some of the longer term actions you're making to correct that, but what are some levers you can pull even near term to help revenue accelerate?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Okay. This is Don. In the near term, we think the changes that we're making in Basic Economy are going to help us. It's going to make the product more competitive. It's going to allow us to offer the product to more customers, and we think that's going to help our yield performance. In addition to that, some of the schedule changes that we're making and taking capacity out are going to help us in the domestic market as well. We still see a strong corporate strength, again our corporate revenue was up 10%, and that continues to be strong. As we went through the quarter, we saw improving yields in close-in build. And we expect, as we look forward, into the third quarter, that the domestic market is going to be better for us in the third quarter than in the second.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nJ. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Doug, you talked a lot about emphasizing sort of cost control and positioning the airline for a higher fuel price environment. As you think about the time it's going to take to get back to targeted earnings levels, how quick of a ramp should we be expecting in terms of your ability to kind of get this repositioning and reacceleration on the cost side to get the earnings level right?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, David. Hard question to answer, so I'm going to punt for the most part, in terms of trying to give you when exactly we think we'll be back there. What we are happy to say is 2019 certainly feels, as we look forward, like it will be a better year than 2018, and that's nice progression back to the target, but I don't know for certain when we'll get there.\nJ. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Is it fair to say that the inflection in pre-tax margin implied in the 4Q guide is a good sort of signal that we're coming at least to a turn on the pre-tax margin side?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Again, I don't know that we're going to be able to tell you what quarter even we think we're going to make the flip at this point. But, again, as we look at this just year by year, 2019 certainly feels a lot better than 2018, and that's where we are at this point.\nJ. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. And then \u2013 and maybe just a quick follow-up question on the change in the Basic Economy and adding the bag fee there. Is that an attempt to maybe kind of charge more for the Basic Economy product or just to fill more basic seats? I'm just trying to make sure I understand what the intent of that change is from a marketing standpoint?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah, David, we got to a point where we weren't competitive. We launched this product about a year ago. As Robert said, we've been very happy with the results, but while that's true, for prices to the customers who are the buyers of this, there's a big airline out there who doesn't charge for the carryon and there are now filters on things like your Google search that ask you if indeed you want to bring a carryon or not, and if you say yes, all of a sudden the American flights don't show up nearly as high as they did before because it adds $20 to our fare. Nothing wrong with that, that's accurate. But when you get yourself in a position in this business where price-sensitive customers find themselves with lower fares on truly competitive airlines like that, we have to take that under consideration. And that's what it is. We put this product out with a different model than others had done in the past, and we've gotten to the point where we think the right thing to do is to get in line with the competition.\nJ. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks a lot for the added color. Thanks.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning. First one, it's kind of a follow-up to the first question this morning. But you cite the trailing growth of revenue relative to the competition. You talk about entity mix, but also can see that some of it is domestic. So, my question is how much of the domestic weakness do you attribute to self-inflicted woes? And how much is reflective of United and Delta taking share from you? Because it is beginning to feel mostly like the latter, and if that's accurate, it's not clear to me that you're doing enough to stem the bleeding.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not sure how you come to the conclusion, maybe you can tell us as to why it feels like, it's a share shift because that's not what we see.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Again, I'm not sure I \u2013 look, what we believe is what we said. More difficult comps year-over-year, without a doubt. On a two-year basis, we're still up more than both of those airlines.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: But look, you're right. We acknowledge, we think we can do better. And we think the steps we're taking primarily as it relates to this Basic Economy product are the difference. But, yeah, there's nothing where \u2013 as Robert said, our corporate revenues are up 10%. We don't see share movement anywhere. I will tell you, I asked the team to go look at the fact that United has announced how much they're growing in and out of Chicago, and clearly us being a Chicago hub carrier has to have some impact, because it doesn't mean we become unprofitable. It just means that if you add capacity, if you add ASMs at a rate greater than demand in a route where there weren't before, you see \u2013 we have some impact on. But the interesting result of that work was to show that the bulk of that flying out of Chicago, at least the ASMs are largely to Hawaii. And other than Hawaii growth, the growth rates in Chicago at least in American markets were lower than they were throughout the rest of the United States. So, look \u2013 anyway, we don't view this as a share loss. What we view it as is, well again, other than this Basic Economy issue, where again people might have booked another carrier because they saw a lower fare on them than us. But it's much more about \u2013 it's much more about when capacity grows in excess of demand, you're going to see some pressures on revenues. We've offset most of that, but not all of it. And we think we're going to get back to outperforming as we move forward.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: I'll just add...\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks.\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: ...just, one other item. As we kind of look through kind of opportunities in kind of the revenue management space, that really kind of affects us globally. We think there is an opportunity for us to do better in periods of really low demand or trough periods. And this applies really across the network, but it does apply to the domestic market as well, as we look at it. Obviously, our objective here is not to maximize load factor, it's to maximize revenue. But in periods of really low demand, we think there's an opportunity for us to actually grow our load factor and maintain the overall yield portfolio we also have. That's through some adjustments we're going to be making in our forecasting, and also our kind of work process within the revenue management space. We also believe that during these time periods, there are some real channel-specific things that we can do as well. And so, we think this is really kind of the next evolution for us and next focus. We think there's a lot of leverage in this going forward, really across the entire business.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And ...\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Jamie, I'm sorry. There's one more thing...\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Please.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: ... I probably should have mentioned by now. If you look at where our growth has been over the last year at American, it's not been in our most profitable hubs. Indeed, we're building up LAX, which is the right thing to do. Long term strategic, it was some growth in Philadelphia in response to some competitive incursions there to make sure that we were competitive. But not in places like Dallas and Charlotte, and not in places like our strongest hubs, which some of our other competitors did. So, that'll also have an effect. But long and short of it was we're really comfortable with where we are in terms of our relative positioning and feel really good about the future.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Well as a follow-up on that, Doug, and let me just push you a little bit tougher here, we all remember a time when United couldn't punch its way out of a paper bag, when they were the perennial last place member of the big three. And what I'm being asked right now from investors is whether American has now simply stepped into the shoes that United once occupied. Maybe that is simply the construct of the industry going forward. It's almost like three, five, seven, you're going to have one chronic outperformer, let's call that Delta, in fairness. You have the silver medalist, let's call it United, and then inevitably American brings up the rear. So, how do you push back on that? What structural component of the American story can you point to, other than just trying harder, which is all well and good and to be applauded, to convince us that you can get off the bronze medal podium, so to speak?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah. You're going to have to watch us going forward, I guess, Jamie, if that's what your view is. We vehemently disagree, and I think that would be an overreaction too. So anyway, our competitors are doing a nice job, and one of them in particular had a lot more upside for a lot of reasons than we did, but that doesn't mean that we think we're not \\ go do exactly what we plan to do, which would be the best airline in the world. So, anyway, I would encourage them to look a little longer term.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. All right. I appreciate you taking so much time for questions. Thanks, gentlemen.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, everybody. Good morning. I'm curious how you can speak so confidently about growing margins next year, given fuel is high and RASM is unknowable. Are you basically telling us right now that you think you can do better than the 1% to 2% CASM x guide?\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: We're on that CASM number. We do not \u2013 we're guiding that for the next two years staying in the 1% to 2% range. So, we have not changed that. We will go through the planning process. We haven't done that yet for next year and we'll update that when we go through that planning process, but there's no change to the 2019 or 2020 CASM guide at this point in time.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: All right. And then, Doug, honestly I'm surprised to hear you continue to beat the drum on this balance sheet stuff around asset values because, with all due respect, it really only matters if you're mortgaging assets and that's not a scenario that any equity holder cares about. So, what about \u2013 I'll put this differently, what about the drag of interest expense it provides on your P&L, which gives you so much less margin for error on the RASM, CASM stuff? Doesn't that factor into the equation somehow?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: It all factors into the equation. At the end of the day you end up with a capital allocation strategy that we think optimizes the value of the firm, and what we believe is, of course that will result in higher interest expense. It also results in fewer shares outstanding and it results in therefore a mix of less equity, which is more expensive, and more debt, which is much less expensive. So, we believe we have the right mix, particularly given what happens in terms of our cost to the extent you went in the other direction. It doesn't, in this business, doesn't tend to reduce our borrowing cost, particularly because we're borrowing against really strong assets. So, we're hard pressed to come to the conclusion that delevering from where we are today, and particularly with the cash balance we hold, makes sense for our investors.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: All right. Thank you.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Hunter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.\nSusan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes. Good morning, everyone. So, just a question on operational performance. Even before the PSA issues, your on-time baggage, et cetera has lagged and customer service complaints have been pretty high. I'm just wondering, United's been pretty vocal with Core4 trading, et cetera, can you just talk a little bit about what you're doing to address your operational issue?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Sure. I'll chime in here. Performance the last couple of months hasn't been where we've wanted it. We can point to some things. Certainly the PSA outage was one item. We've also had some pretty tough weather year-over-year out of Miami, which has impacted the system. But we see a lot of opportunity going forward, though. And certainly getting the airline fully integrated is going to be a big deal to us. We're making good progress on the path to getting our flight attendants integrated, and we're also hopeful that we'll have our fleet and mechanics fully integrated as we look forward as well. The kind of things that you look to improve upon is certainly aircraft reliability. And we're dedicating a lot of effort to making sure that as we move toward some of the older fleets, the 767s and the Super 80s, as they move out of the fleet, that they get the attention that they deserve. Our folks are working really hard. We've got a game plan to get back really to being where we expect to be, which is best at departing on time, and completing flights, and ensuring that bags are delivered too. Couple points I'd like to note, though. First off, I do know that in terms of servicing customers as far as missed connections, I know that we're doing a nice job there as we've seen missed connections drop year-over-year. We've seen complaints drop certainly from a DOT perspective. And then, also our internal measures in terms of compliments and complaints ratios have improved as well. No doubt, we've got some work to do. We're in the middle of the summer, our team's working hard, and we know we'll get back on path.\nSusan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Good morning.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the expansion at DFW and Charlotte. Just around the timing and just how you expect that to flow through maybe the cost and the revenue lines, as those kind of come on? Because it seems like maybe your commentary on the DFW performance means that we should see some good incremental revenue contribution from those.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: As far as the gates go, we anticipate that we'll start getting those online late in the first quarter, early second quarter in Dallas-Fort Worth. And then we'll ramp up from there, the 15 gates. In Charlotte, the seven gates really they start coming online at the end of the year \u2013 more towards the end of the year, and I think that we'll have four or so gates ready in the third quarter and fourth quarter and the remainder of those in 2019. And what we intend to do is that we have a nice opportunity to ensure first that any growth that we do is positioned there, but as well there's opportunity for redeployment from underperforming places within our network. And we're going through that process, and you'll see a lot of movement on that and announcements on that forthcoming in the months to come in 2018.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, the benefits of that really may be second half 2019, is that fair?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah, that's fair, Savi.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then if I might just follow up on the domestic, 3Q, how much of that benefits from kind of the look back with the hurricane impact last year? So, ex-hurricane impact, are you kind of expecting maybe domestic RASM to be down year-over-year?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: No. This is Don Casey. No, we ended up with a benefit related to Hurricane Harvey. We had a negative impact associated with Maria and Irma, and net-net all of the hurricanes last year had about a three-tenths benefit to us. So even outside of the hurricane effect, we see unit revenue domestic improving from the second quarter.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Doug, when you and the board consider what the appropriate organizational structure is for the company, and I'm talking about the airline versus the loyalty program, how do you have that conversation and make the decision without knowing how a third-party would value your loyalty program? Isn't that just good due diligence to understand how the market would value that business?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Well anyway, Joseph, I'll answer the question this way. We do indeed have a loyalty program that we think is the best in the world and that is real value. We think that value accrues to American Airlines, and therefore to American Airlines shareholders. And if we were to separate it, we worry about the ability to retain that value because...\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Doug, you realize there's an option here where you don't have to separate it. You can just monetize a minority stake to prove to the market what it's worth. That is an option, right?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Joseph, to answer your basic \u2013 on your first question, as to whether we look at this, the answer is yes. We have indeed looked at it, and we'll continue to look at it. With our shareholders' interest at heart, what I'm telling you is we've done that analysis and that due diligence. To this point, we've not decided that's in the best interest of our shareholders.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. The guidance for the full year implies a margin of about 8%. If I back out the marketing fees you guys get from the card partners, it's closer to 3% to 4%. Do you think that if the two businesses were internally viewed separately and forced to stand on their own, that you would be able to manage the airline side to a better margin than what seems to be pretty low for the largest airline in the world?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: We don't. And furthermore, we think it's hard to separate those businesses. They're so intricately related indeed. What the card is, Joseph, is another distribution channel. It's a way in which people purchase tickets on American Airlines. And it's a valuable distribution channel, but that's what it is. And if we separate that out of the airline, I don't think those margins can be separated or should be because I don't believe as you do so. They remain the same.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, gentlemen.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hi.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Doug, just a high-level question for you. As far as giving earnings guidance for the full year, do you think maybe that wasn't the right decision, given that it's tough to predict, movement in fuel, the lag between fuel and fares, et cetera? I would just love your thoughts there.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. We went down this road reluctantly. We at American for quite some time have been suggesting that earnings targets and things like that were, one, hard to do in this business because of the volatility of things like fuel, and two, led to short-term mentality that we didn't think was healthy. So, having said that, as others did it and as investors, at least the analyst community continued to suggest to us that that was important to our investors. We acquiesced and we're there now. We're not intending to change it at least for this year, I guess, because we worry that doing so, particularly as we were pulling it down, would look like we just didn't want to tell you what we thought it was, but it's certainly not the case. But look, I thought the memo from Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett was right on point. I believe that we as business do \u2013 our shareholders and the people we employ, the people we serve a disservice by focusing too much on the near term. And that doesn't mean you definitely do that if indeed you get focused on quarterly earnings, but you can, so there's a possibility it happens, and it's just something -like I said, we went into it reluctantly. You're intelligent to note it. Anyway, we are where we are. We'll continue to do it. We'll continue to look at whether it makes sense for us, but I don't think it helps us make right decisions. I don't think it helps us make the best decisions for our shareholders. To the extent we still make the best decisions for our shareholders and it's of use to our investors, that's something we'll continue to do.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Doug. And on the capacity adjustments, you guys are obviously being pretty aggressive, I think more so versus your peers. How do you get comfortable with the fact that those capacity adjustments will stick given that others aren't necessarily playing along and may just backfill some of the growth that you cut?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: It's a competitive marketplace. We think that we're sizing the airline that's right for American, American's network, and American's customers. And as we take a look forward, we really like the opportunity that we have in front of us in DFW and Charlotte and the opportunities that we have there. So, we're keeping an eye on it. Certainly our market position in our hubs is important, and we have to offer a network that is attractive to our customers and we'll make sure that we continue to do that.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: And just to be clear, to the extent we are reducing any existing flying, we're still growing somewhat, and the routes that we're reducing, we're reducing because they're not profitable at these levels of fuel price. That means what we call utilization flying. That is flying where aircraft are otherwise sitting due to our hub-and-spoke structure, and we can fly them somewhere and back \u2013 and get them back into the hub, and you just have the variable cost of that route. But that variable cost is largely fuel. So, if you can't cover the cost, that doesn't make sense to fly. That's not something anyone will backfill, as you say. And it's other routes that just, again, in these times don't make sense for us, and that's flying in and out of our hubs. So, no real concern on our part that someone will come into flying that we would reduce. And as Robert said correctly, we got to manage our capacity based on what we think is best for American.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hello, Helane.\nHelane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Oh, thanks. Hi, guys. Thanks very much for getting me in. So, here is my question, and it has more to do with technology. When you look at what happened to PSA, is that something that was avoidable? And if not, is there something you can do that would enable you to avoid issues like that going forward?\nMaya Leibman - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hi, Helane, this is Maya. What I would say is, I'd love to tell you that technology is bulletproof and that every issue is avoidable, but unfortunately that's not the case. And in this particular incident, we had an unusual issue, where we had both primary and redundant servers that were designed to take the load should one server fail. But in this case, because of the nature of the issue and because of how unusual it was, it took down both our primary and redundant servers. I think that there's a lot that we do and that all airlines do that everyone in my position does to ensure that we are doing the utmost to prevent any outages. And I think we have a comprehensive program around disaster recovery, around high availability and redundancy, and that's our objective. The problem is that technology isn't always quite as bulletproof as we'd like it to be. And in the airline industry, issues are very immediately apparent to the entire public, and they're very negatively impactful.\nHelane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thank you, Maya, I appreciate that response. And then, just a quick question on the decision to adjust CapEx, I guess. Should we just think about it as two independent airlines made aircraft decisions based on their independence, and they came together and they have to adjust capacity growth or plans? Or should we think about it as a cash flow issue?\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: I view it as one airline making a capacity decision. We have the ability to do and have more large RJs and we were able to negotiate a deal with Embraer and Bombardier to bring in those aircraft earlier. The push of the A321s is more of a, we have the capacity already, we have aircraft that we can keep around, we're putting 737s through the Oasis Project and modifying those aircraft, so there really wasn't the need to take on new aircraft at this point in time, which enabled us to push them out till 2024. So, it's really looking at the delivery stream and making sure that you're not \u2013 you don't want to replace aircraft too early when other aircraft are fine and can be flown in the markets that we have. So, that was just more of a decision from a CapEx standpoint to push those out just from a need perspective on the narrow-body aircraft.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: And, Helane, it's Doug. Thanks for asking, that's a good distinction. We have in the past talked about deferral of aircraft and told you that we did put together two fleet types and we looked at it, we had too many aircraft coming when you had enough. At certain times we were able to defer some. This one, as Derek just said, is not that. We had already done most of that \u2013 I think all of that work actually. This is the result of given the existing environment making sure that we actually wanted to take airplanes in those times and we come to the conclusion we don't.\nHelane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thank you so much, team. I appreciate the response.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hey, Dan.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Oh, hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. JVs LATAM, Aer Lingus and Qantas, big picture, what does the roadmap look like from here for approval to implementation? Is the expectation that these could be implemented sometime next year? And then what is the revenue pie that you're going to be trying to optimize with these partners?\nStephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Well, let me talk about the \u2013 this is Steve Johnson by the way. Let me talk about the implementation, and Don can talk about the revenue.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: The timing, he asked about.\nStephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.: That's what I meant. I think there remains a chance that we can get Qantas approved this year. We're working very closely with the DOT there. They're taking really a fresh and I think very thoughtful look at the whole concept of antitrust immunity around JBs, and Qantas is turning out to be the platform for that. So, it has taken a little longer than we had hoped, but we remain optimistic that it's going to get done, and we remain hopeful that we can get it done, get the approval in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter. Aer Lingus is \u2013 should, I think we all thought that Aer Lingus would be a straightforward application, but the DOT again is taking a different look at Aer Lingus, primarily around the idea about putting a low-cost, low-fare carrier into a joint business. Their view, that's not been done before, and they want to make sure that that's going to deliver the consumer benefits that we promise. So, that's going to take a little bit more time. And my guess is that Aer Lingus is probably going to be an early 2019 decision by the DOT, so implementation after that. LATAM is \u2013 we're still waiting to hear from the Chilean competition tribunal that's reviewing that, and once we've heard from them, we're actually going to file a new application in LATAM because our application now is more than two years old and we want to update that and use the learnings that we've had in Qantas and Aer Lingus to supplement that application. That's certainly going to be acted on by the DOT some time in probably the second half of 2019, I would've thought.\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: And in terms of potential benefit, look, we're able to offer more choice for our customers and a joint business relationship ensures that we're able to sell on each other's networks, and really give customers the opportunity for the best of what the joint business partners have to offer. And so we look forward to that as these approvals come.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I see. Okay. $2.9 billion in revenue initiatives. What have you captured so far? What is the updated dollar goal for 2019? And what potential exists to accelerate some of these benefits?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: What I'd tell you is that we're certainly down the path and out of the first year. I think what we had said, we're about $0.5 billion...\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: For the first half of the year.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: First half of the year about $0.5 billion through. There's obviously a little bit of a setback because of Basic Economy, but with the change to the program, we think that we will be able to recapture some of what had fallen off. In addition to that, though, we know that there are other opportunities that will more than make up for whatever's been lost with Basic Economy. So, if we take a look at, from Investor Day last fall, with where we stand today and what we're adding to it, we think that we're on track. And Derek, can say a little bit more.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: And Dan, what we presented was $1.35 billion in 2018 for the revenue synergies and $775 million in 2019. I think there's about a shift of about $200 million, so the 2018 will be down to about $1 billion \u2013 $1.1 billion $1.5 billion, but that $200 million is going to go into 2019, so we're up to $975 million in 2019. So, the way to look at it is we're a little bit behind due to some of the Basic Economy stuff that we talked about. But that shift is going to go into 2019, that $200 million, as we stay on target for the $2.9 billion.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the analyst portion of today's question-and-answer session. We would now like to open the call to media questions. Our first media question comes from Andrew Tangel with Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.\nAndrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal: Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal: Hey. Wanted to ask about fuel costs and fares and theirs and you all's ability to pass this along to customers. How much are fares are going up? How much more sort of longer term are you all going to be able to pass along these fuel costs that are here to stay to customers? At what point do fare increases dampen demand and wind up preventing you all from growing revenue? So, what's the limit of you all's ability to raise fares, recoup these fuel costs as consumers are facing higher costs on other products too?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Well, I'll just start and others can add in. It's a competitive marketplace and at the end of the day it's all about supply and demand. And where we stand today, we see a strong demand for the product, and so we're optimistic that there's the chance to recover some of the cost of the increase in the price of fuel. But over the long run, it depends on the economy and it depends on how much supply is out in the marketplace, and that supply is seats. So, what we see though is, in our markets, we see a prudent deployment of capacity, and we've seen signs of recovery, and as we stated, we've seen successive quarters of year-over-year revenue improvement, and we expect to see that as we head into the rest of 2018 and into 2019 as well. Don?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Again, we're also diversifying some of our sources of revenue as well through growing our credit card business and our ancillary revenue stream, all of which will help us grow the top line.\nAndrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal: And as a follow-up on the issue with Taiwan and in references to Taiwan on your website and other ways that Chinese government has now been focused on. Can you walk us through your all's decision in addressing the Chinese demands the way you all did and what are you looking for from the U.S. government now, as China reportedly has said that American Airlines or U.S. airlines response to their demands has been incomplete?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah, look, I'd prefer not to do that, if it's okay by you. I'll give you the blow by blow of this. What I'll tell you is we had a deadline. We complied within the deadline with what we thought was a nice solution for everyone, and hopefully, that'll be the case. That's where we stand right now.\nAndrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal: Can I ask, just generally speaking then, why you all are uncomfortable with addressing sort of the decision-making process and your thoughts on doing what you all did, at least in terms of international affairs? But earlier you all have weighed in on domestic affairs, at least regarding the migrant children transport. Is this just trickier for some reason? Can you at least address why you won't address the decision-making process?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Sure. Yes, it's a matter of international affairs that is I think more important to those countries than to American Airlines, and we don't want to intervene in that process.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Your line is open.\nMary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP: Hi. Good morning. Don, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about Basic Economy, and what you were seeing that made you decide you needed to make a change. Like were you just not able to sell the fares at all, were you having to really deeply discount them, and sort of when you realized that you did have a big problem?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: That was to you, Don.\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Okay. Hey, yeah. First of all, I wouldn't describe it as a big problem. This was really an issue of competitiveness, right? We've been kind of watching it now since we rolled the product out. The industry hasn't aligned on product attributes, and we think kind of shifting this direction is going to allow us to offer this choice to more customers and that's going to lead to a better revenue outcome for us.\nMary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP: Okay. But can you comment on what made you realize that there was an issue caused by not being aligned with the others? Was it that you weren't selling Basic Economy or what?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: We weren't giving as many customers the choice for buying Basic Economy under our current product configuration and by changing the attributes, we're going to be able to offer this product to more customers.\nMary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP: So, that sounds to me like you weren't selling as much as you wanted to.\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Yes. The scope wasn't as large as we had originally anticipated, and we think this is going to increase the scope of coverage of the product.\nMary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP: Okay. And can you give us an idea of how far it lagged, what you had anticipated?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: No. I think all we'll say is that from where we are right now we expect the results to improve in excess of $100 million a year.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: And look Mary, I'll just point out because it's not obvious I mean this is good news for customers. Again, we're amending the product to be more customer friendly and allowing customers to purchase that product to carry on a bag without having to pay for it, but still having constraints on the product that some of our customers will choose to not want to purchase that product, but purchase a different product.\nMary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP: Okay. Thank you.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Mary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Your line is open.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hi, David.\nDavid Koenig - The Associated Press: Hi. Good morning. Well, Mary really asked my question, but let me then jump to something else. Robert, did you say during the analyst section that the reduction in 3Q and 4Q capacity growth will include China and Brazil? And if I heard that correctly, is that in any sense because you're worried about the trade dispute or rising tariffs cutting into either of those areas?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: David, as a matter of fact these are changes that we've announced previously and it's due to ultimately the profitability that we had seen and certainly as we forecast with higher oil prices. It's due solely to that.\nDavid Koenig - The Associated Press: Okay. All right. Thanks very much.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Your line is open.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hi, Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just another one on Basic Economy. What's the upsell? I think you guys had something like 50% of passengers that were considering Basic and then ended up getting the regular economy? And how do you expect that to change with the baggage allowance?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Our current upsell rate is 63%, and we expect as we change the product attribute with carry-on bag that that's going to go down a little bit to around 50%, but the number of customers that we'll be upselling is going to go up.\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: The number of customers that you're upselling will go up, but...\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: There are going to be more customers that are going to be presented with a choice.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: The product will be available in a lot more places, Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: Oh, so it's a screening issue on Kayak and others. Okay. Got it. And then, Doug, you had previously said this year that fares are too low for oil prices this high. How has that changed? Are fares okay now or how much do you expect or need them to go up to deal with these higher fuel costs?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Well, okay. I should say it this way. Our revenues aren't up as much as our fuel costs are up. So, to maintain earnings we would need to see \u2013 to maintain earnings at parallels we need to see revenues get more in line with the fuel cost increase. So, anyway, what really needs to happen I think, Leslie, is over time capacity adjusts to a level, where it's more in line with demand growth and more in line with the reality of existing fuel prices. I expect that'll happen over time. It'll be gradual. I don't think it's \u2013 certainly there are amazing values out there for customers, for consumers right now that \u2013 all throughout the fare level spectrum, and that'll continue to the extent they go up. It doesn't require a large material increase. But absolutely, when our costs or production goes up, we need to get to a point where we can raise the cost, raise our revenues to a level to cover that cost.\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: Okay. Got it. And then the LATAM JV, will that help you at all with some of the headwinds that you're seeing in Latin America, Brazil, and then some of the political stuff?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: It will once it's implemented. Obviously, we're a ways from getting it implemented, but once it's implemented we think it's going to help us \u2013 have a material benefit for both us and LATAM, as we're able to offer a much, much broader network and much greater choice to customers.\nStephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc.: And this is Steve. Not just LATAM, but Qantas and Aer Lingus, and the JVs that our competitors are applying for \u2013 they provide really fantastic benefits for travelers and our customers, and we look forward to being able to offer that as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patti Waldmeir with Financial Times. Your line is open.\nPatti Waldmeir - Financial Times: All of my very efficient colleagues have asked all my questions. Thanks.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: All right. Thank you. If you think of anything, call us back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Edward Russell with FlightGlobal. Your line is open.\nEdward Russell - FlightGlobal: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious, when you talk about shifting capacity away from less profitable hubs, less profitable markets, what markets or what hubs do you expect are going to be impacted by that shift? Where could we expect to see some cuts?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Here's what I'd tell you. Well, first off, we've been really successful. As I said in my opening comments, we grew DFW by 4% in terms of ASMs and we're able to outpace that with unit revenue growth. And we see our opportunities to be in Charlotte and DFW and filling out the gates in Chicago. We have growth plan for next year, as Derek has said, but it's more or less going to be GDP or lower. And we think that the gates that we have are going to be more than capable of absorbing that.\nEdward Russell - FlightGlobal: Okay.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: And as we take a look at your redeployment opportunities, it really is, as Doug had said, there's utilization opportunities that we're doing now, that maybe we will cut back on. And then, in terms of around the edges, maybe some aircraft in certain parts of the network are better used certainly in those new gates. And so, it won't have a material impact on the hubs outside of DFW and Charlotte and Chicago.\nEdward Russell - FlightGlobal: Okay. So, minimal cuts at hubs like Phoenix or Philadelphia or Miami or those places, is what you're saying?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yes.\nEdward Russell - FlightGlobal: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like turn the call back over to Doug Parker for closing remarks.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Okay. My closing remarks is, thanks for your interest. Thanks for being on with us. If you have any further questions, contact Investor Relations or Corporate Communications. We're here to answer those for you. Thank you very much. Thanks, operator.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.\nDaniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. In the room with us or joining us in the call this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, our President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for question-and-answer session is Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management. We're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on our first quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with a commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our press release that was issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is including in the earnings press release and that can be found on our website at aa.com. A webcast of this will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thanks, again, for joining us. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Dan, and thanks from everybody with us. We reported this morning first quarter results of $357 million income, excluding net special items, that's $0.75 per share, thanks to the hard working people at American Airlines, who are doing a phenomenal job of taking care of our teams and keeping us on track with all of our strategic initiatives. We feel very good about where we're now. Those earnings, of course, are down year-over-year, that's driven by an increase in fuel year-over-year, which Derek will talk about. And indeed that fuel prices have increased yet again just in the last \u2013 since we closed the quarter. So, we've adjusted our full year earnings estimate accordingly. Excluding the fuel price increase, is as I say though everything else feels very good at American. We continue to work against our strategic objectives and made really nice progress in each of those. First, in creating a world-class customer experience. We continue to bring in new aircraft, retire older airplanes in what is the most aggressive modernization of aircraft fleet in the history of commercial aviation continues, with our aircraft age now well below those of our large competitors. We put in place the best property, the best lounge product ever created by a U.S. carrier with Flagship Lounges in Miami, LA, JFK, Chicago, coming soon to Dallas. We've, with the introduction of the Boeing 737 MAX's, we now have satellite Wi-Fi on domestic aircraft, something that will be continued to roll out through the entire fleet through 2019, just a huge advancement in the product for our customers allowing customers to stream. Everyone in the aircraft can stream at the same time, much different than the ground-based Wi-Fi that is in place on most of the American fleet and most of the industry' fleet today. So that work continues as we well know as far our customers on making culture a competitive advantage, a huge initiative in American. That continues, of course. In this quarter, we accrued $29 million for profit sharing for our team during the quarter. But leading forward is the biggest announcement in that regard for the quarter was the aircraft restructuring that we announced earlier in the quarter, which positions us for the future extremely well as it relates to our fleet addressing a couple of the issues that remained with our widebody fleet and pushing off some Boeing 737s, that \u2013 they're allowing us to leave in the fleets of aircraft that weren't quite range retired. And then lastly, on ensuring long-term financial strength, the earnings, in spite of those fuel price increases, contribute well to that initiative. We returned $498 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. We now have done $11.9 billion, $11 billion of which are share repurchases since the program was announced in mid-2014. And we announced yet again today a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by December 31, 2020. So the team's done an amazing job on hitting on all cylinders. I'll let Derek now talk about \u2013 give you more details on those financials and Robert will give you more details on the operations and revenue performance.\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Good. All right. Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. To start, I'd like to recognize and thank our team members who did a great job looking after our customers despite some very difficult weather events over the past few months. Even in the face of some very challenging operational conditions, their hard work allowed us to continue showing the strong revenue growth that we have achieved in recent quarters. We filed our first quarter earnings press release and 10-Q this morning. And as a reminder, on January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting standards relating to revenue recognition as well as the income statement classification of certain pension and benefit costs. As a result, our 2017 statement of operations was recast to reflect these changes. All the period over period comparisons I will talk about today are based on these recast results. Just refer to the first quarter 2018 10-Q filed this morning as well as our 8-K filed January 25, 2018 for our recast 2017 financial statements. Higher fuel prices led to a decline in year-over-year earnings. Our first quarter 2018 GAAP net profit was $186 million or $0.39 per diluted share, as compared to our first quarter 2017 GAAP net profit of $340 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Excluding net special items, we reported a net profit of $357 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus our first quarter 2017 net profit excluding special items of $414 million. Our diluted earnings per share excluding net special items was $0.75, $0.03 better than analyst consensus. The winter storms I mentioned earlier in my remarks resulted in more than 8,000 flight cancellations primarily in the Northeast, and these negatively impacted first quarter earnings by approximately $42 million. On a pre-tax basis, our GAAP first quarter pre-tax profit was $273 million. Excluding net special items, our first quarter pre-tax profit was $468 million, resulting in a pre-tax margin of 4.5%. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we achieved positive unit revenue growth. Total operating revenues were 5.9% year-over-year to a first quarter record $10.4 billion. Passenger revenues were up 5.4% to $9.5 billion on a 1.5% improvement in yields. Our cargo team continues to produce excellent results. Our fleet transformation over the past few years has led to significant up-gauging, which allows us to transport more cargo around our network. This contributed to a 10.9% increase in volume in the first quarter. This increase in traffic, when coupled with an improved global economy, enabled us to grow our cargo revenues by 18.8% to $227 million in the first quarter on a 7.1% increase in yields. Other operating revenues were $694 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by revenues associated with our loyalty program. Total GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $10 billion, up 9.8% versus the same quarter last year. This increase was driven primarily by a $441 million increase in consolidated fuel expenses. Had fuel prices remained unchanged versus the first quarter 2017, our total expenses would have been $412 million lower. Higher salaries and benefits expenses resulted from the mid-contract base pay increase given to our pilots and flight attendants in April of 2017, also contributed to the increase in expenses. As a result, consolidated CASM was $0.1515 in the first quarter of 2018, up 7.3% year-over-year, and our consolidated CASM, ex-fuel and special items, was $0.1157, up 2.8% year-over-year. This was lower than the guidance we provided earlier in the year, due primarily to the timing of certain maintenance expenses, which shifted from the first quarter to the second quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.8 billion in total available liquidity, well above our $7 billion target minimum. The company also has a restricted cash position of $294 million. During the quarter, we completed sale leaseback transactions on the 16 remaining 2018 mainline new deliveries. In addition, we extended our financing commitment with Vendus (10:24) to finance the 10 [Embraer] ERJ-175s delivered later this year and in early 2019. We now have all of our aircraft deliveries in 2018 financed. The company made dividend payments of $48 million and repurchased 4.8 million (sic) [8.4 million] (10:41) shares at a cost of $450 million in the first quarter. Since our share repurchase program started in 2014, we have bought back $11 billion of stock. Our buyback as well as the net issuance of stock and cash extinguishment of convertible debt has reduced our share count by 38% to 467.4 million shares outstanding as of March 31. We also announced in our earnings release this morning that the board has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization for completion by the end of 2020. We filed an investor update this morning, which included our guidance for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect our 2018 capacity to be up approximately 2.5% on a schedule-over-schedule basis or approximately 3% on a schedule-over-actual basis. By region, we expect our 2018 system capacity to be up approximately 3% domestically and 2.5% internationally. We also guided to a second quarter 2018 TRASM forecast increase of 1.5% to 3.5%, and Robert will provide more color on the trends we are seeing in the revenue environment. I also want to tell you more about our One Airline initiative, the company wide project that we discussed at our Media and Investor Day last fall. One Airline is designed to ensure we derive the maximum benefit from the efficiency opportunities created by the merger. We are forecasted on driving lower cost across the business \u2013 are focused on driving lower cost across the business and have identified opportunities in a number of diverse areas, such as simply returning unused airport space, freed up by co-locations and other post-merger changes; shifting a portion of our higher cost regional affiliate flying to lower \u2013 our lower cost wholly-owned subsidiaries; and new projects such as our dynamic re-accom [re-accommodation] project, which enables customers to rebook themselves on the flight of their choice in the event of irregular operations, which in turn, reduces pressure on our reservation call centers. I mentioned on the last earnings call that we expected our One Airline initiative to generate approximately $250 million of cost reductions in 2018, which is $50 million higher than our expectations at our Investor Day. We're excited by the opportunities that we have identified through this process for 2018, and expect more than $1 billion in cost reductions over the next few years. We continue to anticipate that our unit cost growth rate, excluding fuel and special items, will be approximately 2% for 2018, excluding the impact of any new labor agreements. Due to timing of expenses moving out of the first quarter, we anticipate the CASM growth will now peak in the second quarter of 2018, at up 2.5% to 4.5% year-over-year with the rate of CASM declining each quarter after that. Based on the forward curve, as of April 20, we are forecasting a 30% increase year-over-year of consolidated fuel expense in 2018 or an increase of $2.3 billion. For the full year, we now anticipate our fuel price to be between $2.16 to $2.21 per gallon. With these higher forecasted fuel prices, we expect our second quarter of 2018 pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, to be between 7.5% and 9. 5%. Since we gave our EPS guide in early April, higher fuel costs have driven an increase of approximately $0.65 per share, therefore, we are also updating our 2018 earnings per diluted share, excluding net special items guidance to be between $5 and $6 a share. Our CapEx plans for 2018 remain unchanged as we continue to expect to commit $1.8 billion in non-aircraft CapEx projects, with gross aircraft CapEx and PDPs of $1.9 billion. All of our new aircraft deliveries are designed to replace older fleet retirements. Since our last call, we have announced a significant change in our aircraft delivery plans. Following negotiations with Boeing and Airbus, we announced earlier this month that we canceled our order for 22 Airbus A350 aircraft, and expect to take delivery of additional 22 Boeing 787-8s and 25 Boeing 787-9 aircraft between 2020 and 2026. These aircraft will replace our Boeing 767s, Airbus A330-300s and certain older seven \u2013 Boeing 777-200 aircraft. Boeing is also committed to provide operating lease financing for the 787-8 deliveries. In addition, as Doug said, we agreed with Boeing to defer the delivery of 40 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft from between 2020 and 2022 to 2025 and 2026, and agreed with Airbus to defer three A321neo aircraft from 2021 to 2023. These changes further simplify our fleet and better align our aircraft delivery stream with our replacement needs. They also significantly reduce our planned CapEx, aircraft CapEx for 2019 and 2020. We now expect our aircraft CapEx for 2019 to be $2.5 billion with $1.7 billion expected for 2020. We will continue to work with the aircraft manufacturers to find mutually-beneficial opportunities to fine-tune our delivery schedule to meet our network needs. With respect to our pension obligations, we plan to make contributions of approximately 450 \u2013 sorry, $465 million in 2018, which will allow us to maintain the funded status of our plans at 80% for 2018. Roughly $207 million has been contributed through April 2018. So in conclusion, I'd like to once again thank our entire team for another excellent quarter. Your hard work is the foundation of our continued success. And with that, I will turn it over to Robert.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Derek. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Like both Doug and Derek, I'd like to thank our team members for their impressive work throughout the quarter. They worked through challenging weather conditions, including an unprecedented four Nor'easter storms in the first 20 days of March. And as Derek said, during the quarter, we canceled more than 8,000 main line and regional flights due to severe weather. This past winter, our Philadelphia and Chicago O'Hare hubs de-iced on nearly 80 days each. Throughout it all, our front-line teams did a great job of taking care of customers despite the difficult conditions and once again, demonstrated to the world what collaboration and teamwork means. So again, thanks from all of us. During the first quarter, we made tremendous progress on many of our commercial initiatives that we outlined in our Media and Investor Day last fall. As part of that plan, we said that we'd take advantage of the power of our hubs and gateways, strengthen out the domestic network and leverage our existing and potential partnerships to improve our international network. Domestically, we will launch new service to seven markets this summer. These markets not only strengthen the cities with new service, but will also add more connecting routes to our network. For example, the addition of twice-daily from Panama City, Florida to our hubs in Charlotte and DFW, add more than 175 potential O&Ds to our network. The additional of new destinations like Panama City is just one example of how we can unleash the power of our global network which not only has new destinations for our customers but also drive new, margin-accretive, high-quality revenue into our network. Another objective that we outlined was to focus our network where we believe we a have competitive advantage, which is our hubs. In Chicago, we recently opened five new gates that allow us to offer a richer pattern of service for our customers. We also reached an agreement with DFW to get access to additional gates in Terminal E. This allows us to have departures at our largest hub, enabling more customers to access our global network. Over time, and when these changes are complete, we'll operate more than 900 daily departures in DFW. Lastly, in Charlotte, we continue to look for opportunities to add profitable growth and recently we announced that we gained access to seven additional gates, which are expected to start going into service in the fall of 2019 and beyond. We have also enhanced the travel experience between our New York, La Guardia, and Chicago for our business customers by adding that route to our Seattle portfolio. The Seattle is well-known among our business and top travelers, and offers an hourly schedule dedicated, gates, dedicated check-in areas, complimentary meals at mealtimes and first class to and from Chicago, O'Hare. The Free Spirit and First Class, complementary snacks, beer and wine in all cabins. In addition, we recently filed a new application with the U.S. Department of Transportation in February, requesting antitrust immunity for our proposed joint venture with Qantas that will cover our North American and Australia and New Zealand operations. We're excited for this opportunity and look forward to its approval. With respect to our co-brand program, we are really seeing the benefits of our dual issuer model with very strong double-digit year-over-year growth and acquisitions in the first quarter. Our total card spend continues to significantly outpace GDP growth and the growth in our overall program benefits to American grew measurably in the first quarter of 2018 and is on track with our expectations. Our sales initiatives continue to produce strong revenue growth in the corporate segment. In particular, we saw an acceleration of small- to medium-sized corporate account acquisitions, floor performance remains positive with our corporate accounts. We continue to methodically expand Basic Economy, which has been effectively rolled out in the U.S. and certain markets in the Caribbean, Mexico and now across the Atlantic. We are seeing strong upsell up to our main cabin product, with conversion rates now in excess of 60%. We expect further market expansion will follow as we measure our operational and revenue performance. In addition, our highly differentiated Premium Economy product is now installed on 81 widebody aircraft and it's being sold on 58 routes at an average fare that is double the coach cabin fare. Turning to revenue. Our first quarter revenue was up 5.9% year-over-year, and was a record for the first quarter, with 3.5% year-over-year TRASM improvement. Our international performance is very strong due to solid overall demand, improved premium cabin performance, favorable currency impact and Easter shifting to an earlier date compared to 2017. Domestic unit revenue was positive as well driven by improved load factor. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth for this system and the second quarter in a row, where all geographic entities had positive PRASM growth. Much of this improvement is directly attributable to the significant investments we have made over the past few years in our product and operation, as well as the world-class team we have assembled that continues to execute. Our Latin American performance was very strong, with PRASM up 12%, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth. Strength was broad-based with Brazil and Mexico improving in mid-single digits and all other entities improving by double-digits. Atlantic unit revenue was up 2%. Importantly, our underlying coupon performance improved by 8.6%, but we have headwinds this quarter due to the timing of joint business settlements. Premium demand remains strong while coach pricing improved year-over-year. Currency added 4.5 points to Atlantic performance. Pacific PRASM was up 3.1% year-over-year, on basis of improved premium cabin performance. Hong Kong and Japan were our strongest markets year-over-year. In domestic, our consolidated PRASM was up 2%. On a year-over-year basis, our top-performing hubs were Miami and DFW. PRASM from close-in bookings was positive driven by Basic Economy and strong corporate demand. First quarter cargo revenue improved 18.8% year-over-year on both strong volume and yield, continuing the positive trend we've seen since the second half of 2016. Our other revenue was up by 10% driven by increased revenues associated with our loyalty program. Looking forward, we are seeing strong demand for our product both domestically and internationally. On a year-over-year basis, our comps get materially harder as the second quarter of 2017 was up significantly higher than our peers. However, our ongoing and future commercial initiatives will continue to drive revenue growth. We expect our year-over-year TRASM to be up 1.5% to 3.5% in the second quarter. This will mark the seventh quarter in a row of positive unit revenue growth for American. Consistent with the last two quarters, we expect positive unit revenue growth across our network, led by the Atlantic, followed by Pacific and Latin America. As we head into the busy summer travel period, we are encouraged with the economic environment and the strength that we see in passenger demand. We remain focused on the long-term, and we'll make smart investments and expand margins that drive value for our company. We're proud of our accomplishments thus far, and we look forward to the future. And with that said, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin our question-and-answer session.\nOperator: And we'll go first to Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning everyone.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hi.\nAndrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Robert, can you give us a little bit more color around where your corporate negotiated rates are right now? Can you maybe give us some reference to where they are relative to prior peak and have you even seeing a traction accelerate of late on corporate pricing?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: I'm going to let \u2013 I'm looking at Don here to...\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Yes. I mean the market, corporate market continues to be pretty competitive and we're seeing much stronger close-in unit revenue growth. And part of that is related to kind of corporate and business market. In the first quarter, our total revenue related to business travel, it's with our (24:54) corporates, was actually up 7%. So we're seeing quite strong demand. And part of that 7% growth was an increase in average ticket value. So we're seeing the yields and average values go up.\nAndrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And Doug, I guess, what's it going to take to get back into the $5 billion kind of pre-tax income range that you talk about as being almost a baseline earnings number. Is there anything that the team can do to offset this higher fuel right now, because it just seems like maybe some of the domestic capacity out there in the schedules might keep a little bit of a lid on pricing? So is there anything that you can do accelerate on the cost side to help try to get back towards that $5 billion number?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. The answer, of course, is yes. And we can talk about this. Because let me just talk in first about kind of what's going on here and what it does to earnings. The reality is \u2013 I'll start with this. At this level of fuel price, I'm highly confident American Airlines could produce $5 billion of pre-tax earnings. Not right now. But what I'm getting at is this fuel price increase is one of these that's happened very quickly, and it takes time to \u2013 for what's required to get \u2013 to react to that to take place, a lot of which is capacity changes, as you know. So anyway, the facts are these, since last summer, oil prices have increased over 60%. That's a big increase over a short period of time. And the last 12% of that's happened in the last two weeks. So that kind of an increase is going to have a material \u2013 is going to have an impact on airline financials. And you don't see the impact in revenues as that happens. The way revenues respond of course is through either higher fares, higher revenue, PRASM, as you know. So that's what I think. And look, the one good thing, I guess, about higher fuel prices, is it affects everybody. We all end up in the industry, needing to pay for fuel, of course. And as it increases, all of our costs increase. And indeed, the lower cost carriers' costs increase at a greater rate. That's because their cost increase of course has nothing to do with fuel prices. It's all about having a lesser product and about paying people less. So as fuel prices increase, their costs increase at a \u2013 greater than rest of us. And the good news on that is those are the carriers that are growing the fastest, and those are the carriers that are the price leaders. So again, none of that has happened yet. We don't see it yet. But my strong view is that if this is where fuel prices are going to stay for an extended period of time, you'll see those types of things respond. Going back to your $5 billion number \u2013 our number \u2013 what we believe kind of steady-state pre-tax earnings for this business are in a normal year. The number's there, it's just you obviously don't meet that number. But if our \u2013 if we had simply the same fuel price in our 2018 forecast, the 2017 one, Derek told you $2.3 billion of higher fuel, some of that is higher number of gallons, but a very small amount, $300 million of the $2.3 billion. $2 billion of the increase in our fuel price estimate for 2018 is driven entirely by higher prices. So if indeed that hadn't happened (28:37) not suggesting revenues wouldn't be somewhat different if fuel prices were exactly the same. But you all would have numbers that have us over $5 billion in 2018 earnings. So that's what's going on. Fuel prices have risen very quickly, and it takes time to adapt. I view that as a near-term problem, not a long-term problem, one that will get addressed in the long-term, one that the industry can certainly handle over time, but it doesn't happen immediately. And just like when oil prices fell precipitously, whenever that was, three or four years ago, and you saw earnings increase, only to have capacity start to come in and then revenues to fall, I suspect as it goes back up like this, there is a lag effect as well. So finally, to your question, what can we do about it, our \u2013 the main thing is \u2013 we certainly \u2013 look, we're doing everything we can on costs and we'll \u2013 if there was more that we thought made sense, we would have done it already. We don't have anything that's \u2013 now that fuel prices are higher, let's stop doing something that didn't make sense before. We're already going after this. So I don't want to lead you to believe there's \u2013 that we would go and increase or be able to reduce other costs in some material fashion. We'll certainly go do a relook to make sure there's nothing out there that we can't do even faster than Derek described. The way you deal with this primarily is on the revenue side. As our cost of production goes up, the cost of travel should go up in some way. We're not the price leaders in a lot of markets. So we'll see what happens. But none of the forecasts that we talk about anticipates that. So we'll see. But it would certainly seem logical, you see over time. And you see, in our capacity guidance, no change from the last capacity guidance. That's because, as we look out, first off, in the very near term, right into the peak summer schedule, and definitely not in our shareholders' best interest for us to be reducing capacity, as we head into the best part of the year. But as we look beyond that, we will certainly take a look on \u2013 at whether or not \u2013 again assuming fuel prices stay at this level, what's the right level of capacity. And in our case, we're growing less than the others. So there's \u2013 I'm not suggesting that \u2013 I mean we adjust as well. But certainly when you're talking about having less growth, those that are growing the least have less ability to make a large difference. But we certainly will look at ours, make sure that things like utilization flying that we've been adding in, does it still make as much sense? And look at the fleet as well. So that's where the real leverage is, is in the capacity. And I do believe, as we move forward, if indeed this is the steady state level of fuel prices, you'll see less capacity growth that people are talking about right now.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hey, Jamie.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I'm not sure who wants to take this, but why shouldn't the ancillary revenue line also include revenue associated with domestic fuel surcharges? I mean, I get that they're not permitted at the moment, but what I don't understand is why the industry isn't pushing to change this? Airlines want to be compared to other high-quality industrial transports, at least I think they do. But those companies are permitted to levy fuel surcharges. You kick-started industry consolidation. I mean, why isn't this another area where American could take a leadership position?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: We're all looking at each other. Who wants to answer this?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: At the end of the day, it all hits the customer. And so it's a matter of being competitive in our offering. And so we're conscious of that. And we've got to be \u2013 ensure that we're incredibly competitive in terms of the pricing that we offer all-in.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah. And Jamie, look, I could be wrong on this, but I don't think it will make a big difference in the actual price, this implies. It would just be a delineation, and one that we'd need to be moving around, is fuel prices. We know the right answer is to price your product in line with your cost of production. And whether or not it's played out the fuel surcharge or not, as Robert says, the cost \u2013 what matters is what the customer's willing to bear. And we should \u2013 again, certainly, we should all work to set our prices accordingly. We can't \u2013 we can't...\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: But don't you think that the pace of revenue recovery would be hastened, it would be faster if surcharge mechanisms were in place?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yes. I don't know. I guess it's a fair question, but I don't think it's material. I don't think it'll have a material impact on revenues over time, and so it's not something that we've been pushing for.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And second for Robert, low-cost carriers have announced capacity reductions for next year, which most of them have. They're still growing but at a retarded rate. In your mind, is this evidence, the base of the economy is having an impact? I mean ULCC is obviously disagreeing with that, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're right. Do you have any opinion on this?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Whether the base economy is affecting the ULCCs?\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And whether that potentially lies at the root of their decision to reduce capacity next year.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Jamie, we can't talk about why others may or may not change their capacity. If you're asking about...\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: ...whether we think \u2013 if you're asking about whether we think the Basic Economy price is having an impact on ULCCs? Of course, it is. Well \u2013 but prior to Basic Economy, we were matching them across the board. So, and that was having an impact. The real impact on Basic Economy is back to 10 years, but we can actually \u2013 we have a product out there for those customers who don't want to purchase that product, where they can pay a little more and have a more \u2013 a slightly improved products or largely improved products. So anyway, that's helped us more than them. What is impacting ULCCs, I would imagine, is the fact that American and other airlines have dedicated themselves to making sure we're going into be competitive on price probably for \u2013 at any fair level they chose to go to. Jamie, left.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Next.\nOperator: We'll go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, good morning.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Good morning.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Robert, just on the 15 extra gates at DFW. Can you just talk about what that means for Phoenix going forward? It would seem like those 15 gates could accommodate a lot of the flying being done through Phoenix. So how should we think about that?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: At least right now, I'd tell you, the two aren't connected. We know that we have profitable opportunities in the long run in DFW, and these additional gates which I think are going to create a nice regional opportunity and thereby also create some \u2013 free up some capacity for other main line aircraft as well. I think it creates a nice opportunity for the growth that we do have in the future. And as we take a look whether it's DFW or Charlotte, those are great opportunities for us to build on our strategy that we've outlined, which is to make sure that our network is focused on our hubs and gateways and that we expand the places where we have the greatest competitive advantage. And right now that is absolutely focused on DFW and Charlotte.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah. And like I said, Phoenix is doing well. And if you \u2013 relative to other hub performances, Phoenix is performing nicely, so nothing about that makes us think we should do \u2013 we should be doing anything with the Phoenix hub other than continuing to do much like it's doing today. We just think there's opportunities to doing more in Dallas and Charlotte.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then Robert, you've mentioned before that you view the loyalty program and kind of selling miles as another distribution channel that the airline has. It would seem like a very good one, just given how opaque it can be. But I guess my question is, why not use it more \u2013 I get these e-mails offering to sell me miles pretty frequently, it's always a horrible exchange rate. And I don't understand anyone \u2013 why anyone would buy those miles. Why not offer consumers a fair rate to get their dollars into your ecosystem and kind of leverage that distribution channel more effectively?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: We think that we're using the channel and the program appropriately. It's designed to attract and retain customers, and then a tremendous amount of utility is offered by expanding through the relationships that we've been able to establish with the co-brand cards and other partners. We look for opportunities, but we think we're making smart decisions. And in the areas that we see growth, especially with the co-brand cards, we think we're doing the right thing and are really confident in enhancements in those products that we see coming throughout the rest of this year and beyond.\nOperator: We'll go next to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hey, Hunter.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Good morning. Hey, guys. Hey, Doug. So, I realize that this might be a timing issue, and if it is, you can please tell me that. But can you help me understand the rationale for lowering the earnings guide on fuel and then not concurrently at the same time reducing some of that incrementally on productive capacity, or is it just sort of like a timing mismatch between the reporting cycle and capacity planning?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. That's a good question, and I try to answer \u2013 I can do it better now with a more direct question. The answer, yeah, we \u2013 yes, we \u2013 look, just yesterday, as we get ready for our earnings call, it's at a new fuel price, and it's gone up from two weeks we last did it enough that we begin like 12% since \u2013 in the last two weeks. So that led to the EPS guide, and we haven't yet made decisions on capacity that I talked about. But there won't be any, by the way, Hunter, for this summer, nor should there be. So to the extent there are going to be any \u2013 we'll look to do as we start to build our fall schedule and we don't have anything to report on that yet. So does it mean that we're \u2013 you should expect that if fuel prices stay here, we won't make changes. But it's also, there's nothing for us to tell you right now as to what those will be.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then Derek, couple of years ago, on one of these calls, you said we should expect roughly flat interest expense over the next five years. But since then, your margins and earnings have been cut in half. Is there a \u2013 basically cut in half. Is there a thought to redressing that view now that sort of the margin for error above the line is so much thinner?\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: No. Oh, go ahead Doug.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah, no. Sorry. I was just \u2013 Derek said no, and then I'll provide some color, which is \u2013 I mean, part and parcel of it, Jamie is...\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hunter...\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hunter, whoever you are.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: I've been called worse.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: I'm sorry, yes. You have. I'm sorry, Hunter. So anyway, the \u2013 look, the question, of course, if you're asking about lower interest expenses is about (40:23). And we feel really comfortable with our capital structure. In good or bad times, that's why we have it set this way. The way we protect against bad times is by carrying a whole lot of cash, and we continue to do so. More than our competitors, we don't think the right thing for our shareholders is to go pay down incredibly efficient debt, and which is what we have right now. We're paying down \u2013 we pay down debt and have paid down all the higher cost debt, but the debt we're adding now is tied to \u2013 the other point I would make, of course, is we have much higher asset values than our other competitors because of the new aircraft. So there's a reason for the higher debt and it's financed \u2013 it really get rich, we think it's in the best interest of our shareholders to make sure that we avail ourselves of those rates certainly much lower than the cost of equity. And do so \u2013 and then to protect ourselves against any sort of downturn by holding more cash dollars. We like that structure, we think it's best for our shareholders, we think it's best for America and our team.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay, thanks a lot.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks, Hunter.\nOperator: We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, gentlemen.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hi.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Doug, not to beat you up on the fuel and capacity question. But you make a pretty compelling argument about higher fuel leading to lower capacity but how do you reconcile that with last year where we've actually seen the opposite lower, high \u2013 we have lower capacity and now higher capacity, as fuel has moved up, and help me out with that.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: I'll try. To be clear, when I said the capacity would adjust to higher fuel prices over time, I don't think they'll be less capacity. I think there'll be less capacity than there would have been otherwise. So it's hard to know what would have happened to capacity had fuel prices stayed where they were. But I do believe \u2013 and I would certainly agree with you, as fuel prices had risen, even through the back half of last year, I don't think you saw changes in people's capacity adjustment. My own personal view on that is, it ramped pretty quickly, and I don't know that everyone really believed that we're going to stay there. So if you're going to make capacity adjustments or \u2013 a lot \u2013 it requires some belief that out into the future, I think the belief out into the future about oil prices was probably one of \u2013 well, they ran up in a hurry, but there were a lot of fundamental reasons why they could go back to where they've been for the last few years. If indeed now we see they just continue to grow, I can tell you, I think, from our perspective and, therefore, I imagine for almost everyone, it leads you start questioning whether or not this is where we're going to be. This is where we are and there need to be adjustments, so that's what I think. I think you're going to see it run, and you can see changes that ran up in the back half of last year, largely because it was unclear as to whether or not that was the new normal. This is feeling somewhat more like the new normal. So we need to adjust our business plans accordingly.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thanks, Doug. And then another question for you. Historically, you've done a pretty good job of taking advantage of the volatility in your stock. And you've even showed that in some of your presentations. And we've seen that again more recently with the weakness in your stock. I mean, would you consider doing what you did before, which is sort of lever up, buy back your stock and sort of take advantage of these dislocations, if you will, or do you feel like leverages is a bit full now relative to where you want it to be. Maybe that's a question for Derek as well.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah. Well, first up, to be clear, I wouldn't describe what we did as levering up to our stock. It is not what we did. We increased the debt on the company. And as we acquired new long-life assets, which were aircraft and we did that at really efficient rates. So, and at the same time, we had after earnings and making sure we're taking care of our team and taking care of the exceptional amount of pent-up demand for capital in this airline, after making sure we paid off all of our high-cost debt to the extent we still had cash in excess of what we thought was the extremely high level that we like to keep, we did of course what we always do, which is return it to our shareholders, and that remains the commitment. So, to the extent we have cash over and above what we believe the minimum is, having done all of those things, we'll continue return it to our shareholders. And we really \u2013 we try very hard to do it in an intelligent way. And there is no doubt that where the stock is today, it looks like a nice buying opportunity for American Airlines shareholders.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, not to belabor this point up, but can you talk about at that target earnings level that you guys have put out there, like what kind of macro assumptions should we be assuming in the economy? And if we're assuming a stronger economy, shouldn't we also have baked in higher fuel prices, looking back when you set those targets?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? I'm sorry I missed it a little bit.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Well, I guess, what are you assuming underlying in the economy to hit your target earnings level? And shouldn't that also be associated with higher fuel prices? I mean, economic growth and higher energy costs kind of go hand-in-hand. Right?\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Perhaps. Look, as we got \u2013 this may take a little longer than you wanted. Sorry. I got to separate the three, five, seven from like a near-term forecast versus what it really is. So what we have said and continue to say and continue to believe is that we have an airline that has steady-state earnings potential and at the current size of about $5 billion pre-tax per year. We believed that from about the time of the merger, it's been true in some years, not true in the last couple years that we made that or more. We continue to believe that's a good number. We believe in it so much that's how we set our annual incentive compensation for the executives of American Airlines. So if we make $5 billion pre-tax, then we have target bonuses for the team. If it's less than that, we pay less. If it's below $3 billion, there's no bonus. If it's as high as $7 billion, it's a maximum bonus. Those are not \u2013 so they're not just statements we make. Those are \u2013 that's how we compensate ourselves because that's what we believe. So then you ask \u2013 I think what you asked was, well, gee, why didn't your projections have higher fuel prices in it? We didn't go make that \u2013 we didn't go set that number based on projections of any given year. That's a \u2013 those are \u2013 that's a number again that we say should be true in kind of a steady-state year. So I guess a better \u2013 I prefer to answer the question this way, which is, well, then why in 2018, a steady-state year, because you just gave us earnings guidance which is lower than that. What I would tell you is, it's because fuel price alone is driving $2 billion higher expenses in 2018 than it did in 2017, a year where we made $4 billion. So that is what's driving us to not have 2018 currently forecast as one of those years. It's the increase in fuel prices year-over-year. And I do believe, as I said at the outset, that we have an airline that can make $5 billion at $75 a barrel oil. That's not the issue. This is a short-term, a more near-term issue. It happening so fast and going up so quickly. So but if everything stayed at this level, we still believe we have an airline that will make $5 billion in steady-state times.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I appreciate that. And then you guys laid out a lot of commercial initiatives at the Analyst Day last year. I mean, can you tell us where you're seeing the most traction right now across all the new product offering presentation?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: So, yeah, this is exciting for us because there's still so much to come, and we've really accomplished a lot. So Don and I have talked about where we stand with Basic Economy. We think that there's still more room to go there. We've obviously expanded recently into the Atlantic and Mexico and Caribbean. But it's not quite as broad as we think it will be. Premium Economy is really just getting started. We now have, as I mentioned, 81 aircraft in \u2013 with Premium Economy seats, and offering it. So it's really getting started. We won't be done with the fit-out of all of our aircraft until May of next year. But we'll have a sizable chunk out there and selling. And we're \u2013 and as we said, we're seeing great traction on that. And we're seeing fares that are basically double the main cabin fare, which is great. I'll let Don talk a little bit more about revenue management initiatives that we've seen. But then the other things that we laid out at Investor Day were along the lines of making sure our network is producing everything that it can. And we've made good progress, but we're probably only a quarter to a third of the way through, where we think that that will ultimately lead us. You know about the investment that we've made with our sales team and making sure that we're really aggressive out in the marketplace. Good traction there but still really only just getting started. Frequent flyer programs and the work with our co-brand card, about half of the way through on that front, which is great progress. And then we haven't even started yet on the seat harmonization work that we talked about. And that is putting new seats on our [Boeing] 737-300 \u2013 or [Boeing] 737-800 fleet and then also making sure that we have common cabin configurations throughout the rest of our fleet types. That has not even started. And so we think that there is nearly $500 million of benefit that we'll see over the next few years as those installations progress. Don?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Yeah. I'll finish that on the revenue management front. We made our first kind of major enhancement to our kind of coach cabin management system that we put in place in the middle of 2015. And we put that out of place late last year. And just this month, we moved our premium cabin controls to bid-price controls. This is going to enable the system to make much better network decisions at the individual flight level. As Robert mentioned, we had outlined $2.9 billion in revenue initiatives. Everything is on track, and people should really \u2013 I guess right at 60% of that benefit is going to improve in the \u2013 through 2019 to 2021.\nOperator: We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Hey, thanks. I may have missed it in the commentary, but can you talk about what the implied domestic RASM is, if you see that positive in the second quarter? And then as my follow-up, United rolled out Basic Economy I think in May of last year, pretty aggressively, and a bit earlier than you did. It felt like there was some share shift positively to you. Do you \u2013 can you quantify what that impact was in the second and third quarters?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Sure. So first of all, just in terms of domestic performance, and as we look forward into the second quarter, we still seal expect our domestic unit revenue to be positive as we look into the second quarter. This will be the seventh consecutive quarter of positive revenue growth. Basic Economy will be a part of that. We rolled that out in September, so we're continuing to get the benefit of that as we roll through the second and third quarters this year. To be honest with you, we did not see any large impact related to United's rollout of Basic Economy. They did aggressively rolled up only at the fare ladder, when they rolled out in May. But by the time they got through the end of June, they had to have reverse that. And so we saw a little bit of benefit in the second quarter, very little in the third quarter, and so we don't see that as a material year-over-year impact. We just look at our own results.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hey. Just two here, one for Derek, the cancellation of the A350 order. Where does that show or where does that show up in your numbers or will it show up in things like equipment purchase deposits? Should we see any impact on the balance sheet?\nDerek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc.: No. You won't see any impact there. We can't talk about what we did to do that, but it's a very small portion. We had some PDPs that were out for that and we could use those for other things. So that's the \u2013 the biggest thing is no return of PDPs that we had.\nMichael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just a second question to Robert. Robert, you brought this up, and maybe Don can help answer, but when you talked about strong or good close-in performance in the March quarter, I know you mentioned premium or corporate, but I think you also mentioned Basic Economy in the same sentence. Was that \u2013 so Basic Economy driving close-in, was that part of it, or did I not hear correctly?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Yeah. This is Don. Yes, so our Basic Economy helps close-in revenue because many of our corporate customers are not buying Basic Economy, and they're buying up the higher fares where they were being able to buy at the Basic Economy level before we had the Basic Economy product. So part of our kind of strong year-over-year PRASM performance, again, when we get within 7 days departure of is related to the rollout of Basic Economy.\nOperator: \nDaniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Operator, let's go to media.\nOperator: We'll go to Leslie Josephs with CNBC.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Hey Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: Hey. On the fuel costs, are \u2013 I see some carrier imposed charges already. Are fuel surcharges included in that? And do you see that expanding to other markets? I know you can't for domestic, but for some other ones?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: We'll just have to see, I mean we're not going to comment on forward pricing.\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: Okay. Okay.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: It's going to have to \u2013 so we'll see what happens with...\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: Okay. And then just on the Basic Economy, do you see that moving to other markets too and if so where?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Right now as you know, we've recently rolled out into the Atlantic, and we're going to see how it does there and we do think that there's opportunity elsewhere, and it will just take time to see.\nLeslie Josephs - CNBC: Okay. Thank you.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Thanks Leslie.\nOperator: Okay. We'll go next to John Biers with AFP Capital (sic) [Agence France-Presse] (57:26).\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: We're back to the analysts. Hi.\nJohn Biers - Agence France-Presse: Hi. Can you guys hear me?\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yeah, we can.\nJohn Biers - Agence France-Presse: You can. Okay. Hi. It's John Biers with Agence France-Presse actually. My question is you guys talked a lot about higher fuel costs. I wondered we've been hearing some other company first of all do you expect ultimately at the end of the day that that will result in a high \u2013 if fuel prices stay high, that will result in overall higher fares by consumers maybe it's not tomorrow but in the coming months. That'd be my first question. And then second, I would say, we've heard some other companies about, just in general about cost inflation on material. I'm wondering if you had encountered that in for example you're talking with aerospace companies about building the new claims. Is that something you're hearing a lot about in general or is inflation \u2013 do you think inflation in general or something else there?\nDonald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc.: Yeah, okay. On the first one, oil is our second largest expense, a material amount of our total expenses. So when it increases, the cost of air travel increases. So I do believe that consumers will pay more not so much but they will in fact demand in a material way. But that's what happens in most businesses as you're referencing. With your next question as the cost production goes up and indeed the cost of the product generally follows. So if indeed, this is where fuel prices against \u2013 I would expect you would see higher fares to consumers over time. On the second one Robert you go ahead.\nRobert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc.: Yes. On the second one \u2013 yes, the answer is we're constantly engaged with aircraft manufacturers, engine manufacturers \u2013 all suppliers and partners to find new and better ways to work. And so whether that's aircraft design and work on fuel burn on aircraft, and reducing weight, and making things easier to maintain and service \u2013 those are all things that we work on all the time.\nOperator: And at this time there are no further questions. I will turn the call back to management for further comments.\nWilliam Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much, and thank you all for your interest. As always \u2013 if you \u2013 anybody has any questions you can contact the incredible media. If you have any questions, contact corporate communications. We appreciate your interest. Thanks.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."}]
